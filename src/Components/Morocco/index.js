                        <p>Morocco, quite unusually for us, was our first trip for the year. Normally by early September we would have had at least one week holiday by now, or at least a couple of weekends. Steph had been to Utrecht, but that was a business trip as opposed to a leisure holiday. We hadn't because I had started my bootcamp in March, meaning that Steph was the sole mortgage payer - so it was time to be a bit more frugal when it came to overseas trips. </p>
                        <p>Due to how insanely expensive everything was when it came to post-Covid airfare, we'd gone with an overly-cheap option: one piece of hand luggage between us plus two personal items in the form of rucksacks. We'd also gone with the riskiest of risky flight options, getting a self-transfer with an hour and a half to spare. It's rarely a smart play. If you don't make your connecting flight for any reason, you have to eat the cost of it. If it's delayed because of a cancellation or a <i>big</i> delay, you'll get some money back (like we did after Greece) but only for that flight - not for anything after, even if the next flight costs you triple what you paid for the other one.</p>
                        <p>So you can imagine that when it came to the day of our flight, we were checking the flight trackers pretty often. We got the airport a good and a half hours before the flight and were greeted with a gigantic queue that stretched all the way from the very start of the departure entrance all the way to the main gates. Steph noticed that they all had large bags and we realised this was the hold-luggage queue for Easyjet. We were flying with Wizz Air on the way out to Malaga (there were very few options, and if they cancelled another flight then we'd get another grand) then changing for Ryanair for the final flight to Fes .</p>
                        <p>We got to the airport and got ourselves a seat at the Spoons with a view of the gate. We checked our phones again and were slightly nervous to discover that the flight was already delayed by forty minutes! Our window for the connecting flight was getting smaller before we'd even boarded, and - food and a couple of pints aside - we kept our attention on the various updates. </p>
                        <p>The stakes were high. If we didn't catch the flight from Malaga, the next one was at ten the next morning - and not only would we be in a 'fastest finger first' contest with other passengers trying to get on it, there was a chance we'd be paying through the nose. Add to that our agreed course of action if the worst were to come to the worst - sleeping in the airport, taking turns to watch the stuff while the other got some shuteye. It was far from the way we wanted to spend our first night abroad.</p>
                        <p>We finally got to boarding - separately; buying seats together for short-haul is a mug's game - and I found myself in an window seat. Steph found herself in a window seat too, which was bad. She got claustrophobic in a crowded row of seats, but she was happy enough to discover that there was no one in her middle seat. As for me, I was among a huge group, maybe around twenty people, and I could tell within about thirty seconds that Malaga was their end destination. It's always nice to be around obnoxious English people before you get to your holiday destination, because it reminds you how nice it is to leave the place for a while.</p>
                        <p>We arrived at Malaga with only around twenty-five minutes to spare. I grabbed the suitcase and headed to find Steph at the front as soon as possible. We raced through the arrivals gate, getting put to the front of the passport checking queue before sprinting as fast as we could to the gate. We realised with a stomach lurch that we had to go to the main airport then <i>back through security</i>, which at Gatwick would have meant that we almost certainly missed it.</p>
                        <p>We sprinted as fast as our legs would carry us to the main entrance to the airport. Steph, who'd been doing steady cardio while I stuck to weights at the gym, handled it effortlessly whereas I was ugly-heaving within the first couple of minutes. When we managed to catch sight of a departures board, we saw that the Fes flight was delayed by twenty minutes - result! What was more, we got through security in about five minutes. We sprinted towards the gate and made it in good time. The flight was a lot less busy than the Malaga flight, and we were able to sit together in a row of our own. Within an hour we were in Fes. It was around nine at night, only a little later than we'd expected to be there.</p>
                        <p>We got a cab from the airport which would take us to the outskirts of the Medina - those are the perfectly-preserved historical city centres in Morocco - where we were staying; there were no cars allowed inside, only motorbikes. As we drove, I saw men. Lots of men, young to old, hanging out in groups in the darkness. I saw smoky pool clubs with lots of men crammed inside. I did see the occasional woman out and about, but they were sensible and travelled in groups. Before flying, I'd made a mistake in reading some of the horror stories travellers had encountered in Morocco, from sexual harassment, to pickpocketing, and all manner of scams. It didn't do my sense of ease any good, but it did give me advice that turned out to be quite solid.</p>
                        <p>The way it was described, scammers and people who want your money over in Morocco had two very clear categories they assigned to westerners - clueless, naive tourists, and those on the level. You want to make pains to put yourself in the second category, because they get left alone. There are a few ways you can do it: dress modestly, never look like you're lost, and learn a couple of words of Darija, the dialect of Arabic spoken in Morocco. I learned <i>salaam</i> (well, I knew that one before, but I learned the proper pronunciation: sahl-em instead of sal-arm) for hello, <i>iyeh</i> and <i>lla</i> for yes and no respectively, and <i>shokran</i> for thank you. The last of these proved to be like a magic word in the souks; it stopped people bothering us dead in their tracks. </p>
                        <p>On reflection, I regard all of these horror stories as a little silly. I'm not denying anyone's lived experience, but we did absolutely fine, and Moroccans have definitely been one of the more welcoming and hospitable people we've encountered on our journeys.</p>
                        <p>Our cab driver dropped us off at the outer entrance to the Medina and we made our way inside on foot, and I'll summarise the experience by saying that Fes is not a very welcoming place at night. The dirt piles up, there are mangy cats everywhere (normally I'd love a place that has thousands of stray cats, but between the mange and the rabies you don't want to go there) and the dust carts, which take up most of the path, give you a sense that you're penned in. We didn't get hassled here, not as much as during the day, but those that did looked like people we really wanted to get away from.</p>
                        <p>When walking through the Medina, you're on a narrow path between market stalls and indoor shops. It's a tight, winding path that is very difficult to navigate, especially at night. All we had to lead the way was my offline maps, and it was being very temperamental. As we approached our accomodation, we enountered what we would charitably describe as the 'food district'. I say charitable while it was a section in the souk that sold foodstuffs, it was nothing either of us particularly wanted to eat. Live chickens, meat left out, strange gelatinous substances in tubs, and the worst smell you can imagine. From when we'd started walking through the Medina we got periodically assaulted by an open-sewer smell, but this was something else, something rancid that forced itself into your nose.</p>
                        <p>After a while we found our hotel, the <i>Riad Noujoum Medina</i>. Riads are the best place to stay in Morocco. Instead of corporate hotels, they're old mansions that once belonged to wealthy Moroccan families, but have now been partitioned into several rooms around a large internal courtyard. We headed inside and noticed that the place seemed deserted. We waited in the courtyard - which was very grand, with a marble font containing water in the middle - for a bit, then I decided to go seek someone out to help us.</p>
                        <p>The Riad's staircases were a sign of things to come - Morocco is not built for tall guys. I hunched over as I slowly made my way through the place until I got to the roof. I was struck by the amazing view, even though it was the dead of night. You could see lights stretching off into the distance beyond the Medina, showing me the very outer border of Fes. I saw a member of staff up here and greeted him. He didn't speak much English but I managed to communicate that we were here to check in, and he texted the receptionist to come over.</p>
                        <p>He was already downstairs when I got down. His name was Youssuf (he didn't tell us his name, we found it out later after reading the negative reviews - but more on that later!) and he (initially) seemed polite. We paid for the room and went through some forms, and we were shown to our new room - right off of the courtyard. It was a curious space that didn't resemble any room we'd ever stayed at. On the ground level, you had two twin beds with velvety throws and a large space with a TV and a table and chairs. Then, on the right you had the bathroom, but just to the left of that you had some stairs that led up to a mezzannine where the double bed was. It was quite a big space.</p>
                        <p>We showered and got ready for bed. The shower was another thing not built for a man my size. I had to hunch over to use it properly. As we settled into bed, I shared what was on my mind - that I didn't like the look of this place, the place meaning Fes as opposed to the Riad, and that maybe we should have gone to our runner-up choice Germany instead. It was all a very brief culture shock, of course, and Steph said as much. We made the decision to go to bed without dinner that first night. We were too tired - and too wary of nocturnal Fes - to go out and get something, and we hadn't got any snacks. We were slightly peckish, but not badly, and we managed to sleep very quickly.</p>
                        <p>That was, until I woke up in the middle of the night to pee and made the bad miscalculation to try to descend the steep mezzanine stairs without my phone torch. I was fine until the last step, which I overshot, aiming my foot towards the ground and going down like a sack of spuds. My Judo falling skills saved my head and serious extremities, but I wiped out like half a layer of skin on my upper forearm and got a hell of a jolt. That was, thankfully, the last proper accident I would have in Fes.</p>

                        <p>If I don't take particularly well to a place, usually all it takes is a good night's sleep. You clear out the bad mood from yesterday and you get to see a place in the sunlight, which is always better than seeing it in the dark. I woke up first, my arm throbbing, but my belly not kiling me with hunger, which is nice. Steph woke up a little after me and we headed towards the roof for breakfast, and we got to get a great view of the city in the daytime. The view was even more impressive up here. We got a great look at the main walls of the Medina. Morocco takes city walls seriously. They are perfectly preserved from the thousand-or-so years ago that they were built, and you really feel as if you're in some historical epic when you see them.</p>
                        <p>There's a reason for that, of course. The city of Ouarzazate, which we'd be visiting later in the holiday, is like the North African Hollywood, and has film studios where some of the franchises you know and love - Game of Thrones, Gladiator, the Mummy - were shot. But I'd have loved to have used Fes as a filming location if I was a director, as looking out at it, it had a sort of original authenticity that is very rare.</p>
                        <p>Breakfast was great - it's a meal that were never disappointed with in Morocco. There was some European fair - fried eggs and toast, but there were also traditional Moroccan pastries. The coffee was good too, and it all set us up for our first proper day in the city.</p>
                        <p>The city was startingly different during the day - in the best possible way. While it was much busier and more bustling, all the menace was gone. In this light, the souk wasn't a collection of sinister peddlars out of a Monkey's Paw adaption. It was a bright, colourful place with traders showing off interesting wares. Don't get me wrong, though; the need to be alert was still very present. I kept my hands in my pockets and didn't linger on market stalls for more than a few moments. Once you do, of course, it's like a signal to the stallholder to bother you until you swiftly move on. The horrendous 'food district' (I'll keep referring to it with inverted commas because we wouldn't eat anything from there in a million years) was still there too, of course, and the smell hit us as soon as we approached.</p>
                        <p>Our first stop was the Bou Inania Madrasa, a centre of Islamic learning that dates back to the Middle Ages. We found the name funny, as Boo is one of Leo's favourite words. It was only a few minutes' walk away, but a combination of my offline maps not being particularly effective and the sprawling, labyrinthine nature of the Medina. Morocco's Medinas - especially Fes and Marrakech - are some of the hardest places to navigate in the world. Street names are absent or inconsistent. Turnings are barely-signposted and easy to miss unless you're paying very close attention. The pathways are narrow, overcrowded and cramped. And worst of all, you'll very often be told that a road is closed. It isn't, of course - they'll offer to take you to your destination, a much longer way round that will involve a hefty tip. In the multiple times we heard that during the holiday, it was a lie in all but one instance - and we did the same thing each time, ignored them completely and kept walking.</p>
                        <p>We did eventually find the Madrasa after doubling back on ourselves twice. And it really was only a few minutes' walk from our Riad. We got inside, paying the admission and walking into the main square of the Madrasa. It was composed of a single, large courtyard tucked between two souks. The design was very grand, with traditionally Moroccan geometric patterns as well as elaborate bas-reliefs. The Madrasa also featured, or used to feature, an astronomical clock dating back to the Islamic Golden Age. There was a man giving an imprompteau guided tour to a couple of tourists and we made pains to not seem like we were listening, or he'd try to pry a tip out of us too. All in all, the place was very beautiful, but very small. We did the whole thing in around ten minutes and headed towards our next destination, the Jnan Sbil gardens. They were one of the best green spaces in the whole city, a medium walk out of the Medina gates. We passed through the rest of the place and took a quick path out into the rest of the city. It was now mid-morning and the heat was already starting to get stifling. We were sweating quite profusely by the time we got to the place, but luckily we had lots of shade inside because of the trees. The gardens were very pretty, featuring tall, beautiful palm trees as well as lots of lush vegetation. The gardens were big and sprawling, around the size of (at at guess) Ashburton Park and around the same square shape.  </p>
                        <p>The gardens weren't too busy for this time of day, so we had a gentle stroll around, taking advantage of the shade offered. We weren't in there for more than half an hour, and when we got out, the heat had become so much worse. I don't know why, but the heat in Morocco was so much harder to bear than the other hot countries we've been to. It's not an equitorial thing; Sri Lanka is closer to it, and Cuba is about the same latitude. The only other deserts we'd been to, in America, were nowhere near as hot as this, and even Death Valley - technically the hottest place we've ever been to - was about on par as far as discomfort was concerned. We got back to the Medina, and I suggested - and not for the last time in Fes - that we go back to the room for twenty minutes or so, crank up the wonderfully arctic AC and cool down.</p>
                        <p>We got inside and set out planning our afternoon. One sight we really wanted to see in Fes was the famous tanneries, one of the oldest industries in the place. The most famous of these was the Chouara Tannery, which is the one that inevitably comes up when you Google 'Moroccan tannery', if that's something you'd do. As with quite a few elements of exploring the country, one of our first things that we did was stay ahead of all the scams involved. From what we read, we'll be offered countless 'free tours' from scammers who will either demand a hefty tip from you or coerce you into buying something. We also got information to avoid takng mint from people; the smell of the tanneries is apparently something to behold, so you'll be offered mint - for even more of a price.</p>
                        <p>We found an actual shop owner/representative, ie the only people you're supposed to accept a tour from. He took us up to the roof of his shop and gave us an eagle eye view of the tannery, which was amazing. You've got a fantastic view of the various softening, tanning and dyeing of leathers all across the area, compartmentalised into small tubs. These tubs were all-encompassing. Every stage was done in one, and the dyes were stored in containers that looked just like the tubs. It's a pretty amazing sight to watch such a well-oiled machine at work. He offered us some mint, which warily we refused. On the one hand, this ended up being silly because this guy wasn't a scammer, and didn't even seem to expect it when we gave him a tip. On the other, I'm glad we didn't - the smell of the tanneries isn't half bad. It should be bad, as the smell is a combination of ammonia and all sorts of different droppings and chemicals. But there's something about it that's almost nice. It must be the same reason why tarmac and petrol smell nice.</p>
                        <p>We went inside to shop for some leather items, and something caught Steph's eye - a gorgeous-looking leather backpack in what looked like an original brown colour. He started us off at six hundred Dirhams - sixty pound, as thankfully there was a simple ten to one ratio of currency with GBP. Steph knew her business when it came to haggling; she gets it from Terence. The cheeky-but-not-too-low offers, knowing that they need the sale, and not relenting until the deal was in the right price area. She managed to haggle him down to 450 Dirhams including card payment, which he was hesitant for - card fees - but relented grudgingly. </p>
                        <p>We headed out and did some more shopping in the souk, buying some souvenirs - and in my case, something I'd first had my eye on when we decided on Morocco, a kaftan. Kaftans are one of the most common form of mens' clothing around the Islamic world. You'll see a lot of different types of this robe, but Moroccan ones can be quite the thing of beauty with their fancy embroidered collars. I'd wanted one for a while, and it had a practical application too - Berbers have traditionally worn the kaftan to protect themselves from intense heat, as despite being a big garb, it's light and airy, and provides full-body protection.</p>
                        <p> I found a good few of these as we explored, eventually settling on a silky dark red one that I knew from colour coordination experience would definitely match my chinos and lots of my other clothes. The trader selling it was definitely one of the most persistent people we encountered in Morocco, following me around the souk offering lower and lower prices. After lots of demonstrative 'no deal' headshakes and walking away, he brought the price down to 140 Dirhams from its original asking price of (if I recall correctly) 260. This turned into 150 when he didn't have change, but I didn't mind at that point - I liked the kaftan and I'd made a big saving.</p>
                        <p>Our shopping done for the most part, we headed over to a place we'd seen while cooling down in the room - Cafe Clock. The place was a cool-looking rooftop cafe and restaurant - everything in Morocco is rooftop cafes and restaurants - and had views of the top tower of the Madrasa. We also got a view of some of the surrounding streets once we successfully scouted out and moved to a higher seat. At first, we were going to just have some tea and coffee - possibly scouting out the alcohol situation, which turned out to be an understandable bust - but after a while we decided to eat there too. While Steph - who'd made the decision to go veggie while she was here because of the reputation of Moroccan meat as questionable, a decision she wouldn't regret one bit - opted for the veggie cous cous, I went for a camel burger. I like eating non-traditional meat. I've had whale, shark (<i>fermented</i> shark), and bison so far, so was happy to add camel to that list. It was delicious and surprisingly sweet, which may have been partially relish-based but still. Steph really enjoyed her meal too. We hung around for a little while then decided to head back. </p>
                        <p>We sat up on the Riad rooftop for a while - I'd liked the look of the place at night when scouting out the manager, and got a good view of the street below far below. We saw some tourists committing the cardinal sin of looking like they didn't know where they were going, but they quickly moved on. We headed inside to the welcome cool of the air conditioning, showered, and got deciding what to do tomorrow. Tomorrow was the only day that had some flexibility. The following day, we had an excursion booked to Chefchaouen, that beautiful blue city up in the north that you'll have seen photos of. The next day, we had a long train ride to Marrakech. We'd originally earmarked tomorrow as another day in Fes, but Steph had come to the belief that we'd seen all that the place had to offer. </p>
                        <p>Fes is very different to the majority of cities we'd been to in that it really does only have one real attraction - the Medina and its souk. There are literally only three museums I could find in the whole city, and all three of them appeared closed long-term for renovations. As Morocco is still a monarchy, historical palaces are completely off limits to the public. Even the Mosques are completely closed to non-Muslims except for one (that's right, one single Mosque in the country) that's open for tourists over in Casablanca. It's such a sharp contrast with Istanbul, which in addition to a fascinating museum on every street corner has palaces, tombs, and Mosques completely open. Even Cairo, a much worse city than Fes generally (at least in my experience) is absolutely full of Museums, and the Egyptian Museum is probably the greatest I've ever seen in my life.</p>
                        <p>The day I'd proposed would start with a trip to the Marinid tombs, a set of ruins on the outskirts of the city that was the Mausoleum of the Marinids, one of Morocco's historic dynasties, followed by a short walk over to the Borj Nord fortress, where the Arms Museum (one of the three, and possibly the best) was located. Like the other two, there was solid indication that it was closed, but because there was no official website for it (Morocco is really bad about having government websites; there are no official websites for museums, rail transport or - as we'd soon learn - national disaster information) we weren't sure. After that, whether it was open or not, we'd check out the Berber Coin Museum, a shop that had some small features of being a museum, and do some more souvenir shopping.</p>
                        <p>Steph fancied an excursion, and found a couple that looked promising. The first was a trip to the Roman ruin of Volubilis, the town of Moulay Idriss, and the city of Meknes. The second was a trip to an authentic Berber settlement including a cave where families lived. They both seemed interesting, but as I may have mentioned before, I'm not a big fan of excursions. You spend too long on a minibus with a load of pink-faced boomers before being ferried to a place with a sharp time limit for exploration that destroys any notion of immersing yourself in there. Everything you do is measured against the hard deadline, because deep down you have that fear that you'll be left behind in a strange city without any clear means to get back - though that's never the case, you'll just get loads of angry stares from said boomers on the bus who have been waiting.</p>
                        <p>So we dived into the details of the excursions, me admittedly looking for a getout. The Berber caves had some very mixed reviews about being charged through the nose by the unofficial guides. As for the Volubilis trip, the Roman ruins seemed cool, but Moulay Idriss was open to Muslims only so you could only get a view from a nearby hill, and Meknes seemed fairly similar to Fes. We had two quite big excursions on this holiday, Chefchaouen and a big overnight trip to the Sahara, so Steph said she was happy to go with my idea with some skepticism. Our plans agreed, we went to sleep, exhuasted after a long day of walking.</p>
