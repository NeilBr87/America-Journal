                    <div className="days" id="day1">
                            <p>At first, Mexico seemed like a strange choice for us. We'd started our (well, my) foray into East Asia with Japan, and we'd been talking about going to South Korea next. But Steph made the case that having these two holidays a year apart would feel far too samey, and suggested a few of the places she'd also had on the agenda: Kenya for the safari, Chile, and Mexico.</p>
                            <p>I argued that a big Kenyan safari was a bit too expensive a holiday for us at this stage, the alternative being to bum around Nairobi for two weeks - which wasn't really of interest to either of us. Then there was Chile, but this was prohibitively-expensive to travel to, and would be a large logistical ask based on travelling around.</p>
                            <p>Mexico was definitely a viable alternative, and it was definitely of interest to the both of us. At the same time, I had reservations. Most of the major areas of the north - Sinaloa, Juarez, Tijuana - were covered in Foreign Office warnings and were only known to us through shows such as Breaking Bad or Narcos: Mexico. At the same time, a general, consistent warning of anything from simple pickpocketing to having a handgun placed in your mouth while someone cleaned out your pockets were present in both official advice and YouTube travel guides.</p>
                            <p>But, and while I didn't necessarily see things like this at the time, we've been to places with a reputation for crime, particularly Fez and Marrakech (in the latter case the only crime against our persons came from the very ground itself), Istanbul, and Havana. After visiting these cities, I've always felt the same way: That the 'You may get robbed here' warnings should always be suffixed with 'If you're a dumb, conspicuous tourist without any semblance of street smarts'.</p>
                            <p>So it was after some debate that we decided on Mexico, and narrowed it down to our hotspots. I'd always wanted to go Chichén Itzá over in Yucatan, and I'd been quite interested in Mayan culture for the last few years - though hadn't read into more than the juicy parts, like the human sacrifices and the famous Ball-Game, which I'll go into in more detail and, like all aspects of Pre-Columbian cultures, is much more grim than it sounds.</p>
                            <p>So Yucatan was definitely a must for both of us, as well as Mexico City, which is a home of food, history and traveller every traveller should visit. You'll see it referred to here as CDMX, which stands for La Ciudad de México but is usually shortened - for the locals, this is a case of convenience, and for me, it's because I don't know how to pronounce &lt;i&gt;Ciudad&lt;/i&gt; correctly. At first, we had a whole Yucatani road trip planned, including Tulum, Bacalar, Valladolid, Merida, and even - ambitiously - Las Coloradas, the lakes that are the exact same shade of pink as the colour our hydration tablets turn water. But it was a huge logistical ask, and once our rental car company started giving us trouble, we decided to pack it in and do what was very unfamiliar for us - spend a few days at an all-inclusive resort.</p>
                            <p>As a kid, I used to spend my summers with my family in Ibiza and Tenerife, reading Harry Potter by the pool. As soon as I discovered city breaks, I knew this was much more my speed, and Steph is completely the same. The only time we've done all-inclusive as a couple was two nights in Varadero, Cuba as a respite after trekking through Havana in the intense heat for a week. But Cancun, capital of the Yucatan, is known for all-inclusive resorts and we agreed that it wouldn't be the same as Tenerife - mostly because it wasn't as trashy, but also because our fellow guests would be Americans and not purely Brits - we much prefer to spend time with the locals, but Americans are at least tolerable.</p>
                            <p>We originally had just around a 16-day trip, but we realised it clashed with the wedding of our friends Kirsty and Lauri. So we decided on a fifty fifty split between Cancun and Mexico City and an internal flight between. We were doing our all-inclusive before Mexico City, which at first glimpse seemed out of order - the restful retreat coming *before* the hectic city break - but we first realised made good sense as we'd be raring to go do some exploring after a few days lounging in a resort.</p>
                            <p>We structured our holidays around the Bank Holidays in April and May which made things slightly busier and more expensive but it was the best way to get the most out of SWFY's crappy holiday allowance. it didn't add too much to the cost, but as we booked everything between January and February it sure put a time restraint on things. It wasn't long at all before the day arrived, a Friday, and we made our way to the airport in the mid-afternoon. It was mid-April and things were still on the cold side, meaning we were completely unprepared for the immense heat wave coming our way.</p>
                            <p>We got to the airport in good time and lounged it. It wasn't crazy drinking time; there'd be time for that in Cancun. The flight was ten and a half hours, and we'd have passed some of that time sleeping normally, but we'd agreed to go for no more than a quick nap to keep the jetlag at bay. We arrived in the early evening and as soon as we hit the exit, we were hit with two things: The wild heat and a long line of cab companies working out of small shopfronts in a row, each braying and howling for our business, summoning us over with the unending zeal of a Jehovahs on a Sunday Morning. They were incredibly annoying, but they're a key part of it - you go and shop around until you get a good price. Though as we found out, they're all owned by the same company anyway, so it's mostly a smokescreen.</p>
                            <p>We headed towards our first hotel, the Golf Villa Inn. It was a rustic, slightly decayed 19th century colonial villa that looked like it was made of Mayan temple stone but was very comfy and had a great atmosphere to it. When we got home it was around nine at night and we weren't really feeling dinner after the inflight meals. So we got an early night's sleep ready for our first big trip the next day: Chich&eacute;n Itz&aacute;.</p>

                        <div onClick={expandDay2} id="day2ExpanderMorMex" className="headings">
                            <h4 className="dayHeader">Day 2</h4>
                            <h5 className="dayLocation">Chichen Itza</h5>

                            <p>Today we were to do one of four full-day excursions on the trip, and it was the one I was most excited about before going in. I'd heard about Chich&eacute;n Itz&aacute; for a while and had at least a very basic knowledge of Mayan history and culture. I knew about the grand architecture designed by people that had nothing in common with us, in an isolated part of Mesoamerica, and an advanced written language and calendar. I also knew about the brutality, about the ball games where the losing team were horrifically slaughtered (turned out there's more nuance than I thought on that one, but more on that one later), about the sacrifice of slaves, prisoners of war, and anyone who managed to get on the wrong side of the high priests.</p>
                            <p>The Mayans are a fascinating culture all in all, and the grand architecture is only the tip of the iceberg. They had a devotion to their gods that would put the Abbasid Caliphate to shame and a dedicated culture of bathing, grooming, and self-improvement. Just as they're at the bottom end of Mexico, they're at the bottom end of the map of major Pre-Columbian civilisations. Tribes above Mexico (ie Apaches, Navajo and the like) and beneath (like the Lenca and the Taino over in Cuba) have nothing really in common with this advanced group of civilisations, and there are a few reasons behind that - you've got resources, for example, like plentiful stone to build cities. But the major contender is land suitable to transition from hunter-gathering to farming, and that always kinda brings civilisation with it.</p>
                            <p>We were going to have breakfast first though, and headed out to the grand dining room and poolside area. It was early and we were the only people there. We had a couple of cups of coffee each, and while Steph had fruits, I was initially pushing to something a bit more familiar and pedestrian, if only to avoid accidentally eating something mega-spicy before spending the day on a coach sans-toilet.</p>
                            <p>After some prompting from Steph and a chili check, I went for what was definitely going to be one of the breakfast highlights of the trip, Chilaquiles. It's pronounced <i>cheela-keelays</i>, which is a lot of fun to say, and it's got salsa, tortillas, avocado, cream, and onions. It was delicious and nowhere near spicy enough to pose a problem, so I wolfed it down and we headed down the road.</p>
                            <img src={Day1Pic1} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                            <p>We bought some water from a bodega and I bought one thing that I'd completely forgotten - some flip flops for both the beach and for the dirtier hotel rooms. We caught the coach at the nearby bus stop and set off, ready to start our adventure out of Cancun.</p>
                            <img src={Day1Pic2} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                            <p>The Yucatan countryside is very distinct from what we're used to. It's very lush, forest verging on jungle, and apart from the road you can really get a sense of how this place would have looked a thousand years before being seen by European eyes. Our guide, a wiry older man who looked a bit like Ciar&aacute;n Hinds, gave us some fascinating facts about the Mayan pantheon, calendar, and hieroglyphs. It was a couple of hours to our first stop, the cenotes. Cenotes are these large underground lakes that you can swim in, and we'd be having our lunch and a tequila tasting in the same area. We did the tequila tasting first, and gathered around a small cabana where a large number of tequilas were laid out. The tasting guide gave an overview of the history and distillation of tequila, and also gave us some knowledge that would ruin tequila in the UK for us going forward: That only lesser tequila was generally exported, and that the reason we see tequila as a 'burning' drink is because the stuff that hits foreign shores is generally only good enough for shots nor mixers. The only burnless, sippable tequila is only available on the domestic market.</p>
                            <img src={Day1Pic3} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                            <p>Of course, he was a salesman first and foremost, but I'd be lying if I said that the tequila I'd had before coming to Mexico was half as good as what we had over there. He was also a no-nonsense sort of guy, and an inconsiderate couple who'd been talking amongst themselves quickly found themselves on the receiving end of his ire. We listened politely, Steph intently and me doing the whole overeager active listening thing that always seems to get any speaker to look my way. We tried a couple of pure, aged tequilas which were delicious, but also tried some tequilas with chocolate, marzipan and some other surprising favourites. We thought about buying, but reasoned that we'd have lots of opportunities to buy and didn't want to carry a bottle around.</p>
                            <p>We went for lunch after and had delicious, flavoursome tacos, the first of many of the trip. There was a taco bar and we loaded up our plates. Steph stuck to the tacos while I also went to the buffet and had some delicious empanadas. After lunch, we headed over to the cenotes. At first, we thought we thought in filling our bellies we'd lost ourselves all but twenty minutes' swimming before we had to move on, but we realised that despite still being in the Yucatan and only around two hours out from Cancun, we'd somehow gone back an hour. It's like London and Birmingham being on two different timezones - though in all fairness that wouldn't be a bad thing.</p>
                            <p>We changed into our bathing stuff and headed down to the cenote. We had to wear a life jacket because due to the depth and other environmental factors, there's no buoyancy, so unless you're doggy-paddling with some gusto, you're going to sync. The water was lovely and cold, perfect after lunch in the sun. There was a wooden diving platform too, and while I didn't have the cajones to do a full blown dive into that water, it was a big enough jump in that I felt myself freefalling through the air for a couple of seconds.</p>
                            <p>We got back to our shoes and towels only to discover that, bizarrely, someone had tried Steph's sandals on. We were weirded out by that but we got to the lockers, changed, and headed back onto the bus.</p>
                            <img src={Day1Pic4} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                            <p>Our next stop was Valladolid, and unlike Cancun, this is a real life Mexican city. Well, it's more like a large town, but it's very pretty and picturesque, with a leafy park that forms the main square. In the same city center there's a large, crumbling cathedral that dates back to the first hundred years of New Spain. There's also several picturesque bodegas and places to eat, and we helped ourselves to a delicious tamarind slushie. We only had around half an hour here, but we used it well.</p>
                            <img src={Day1Pic5} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                            <p>It was three quarters of an hour to our primary destination - Chich&eacute;n Itz&aacute;. As we drove through Valladolid and the surrounding countryside, our guide told us more about the social division in the Yucatan between those of primarily Mayan or Spanish DNA, including all sorts of caste terms depending on how much of each side's DNA you had - naturally and unfortunately with Spanish DNA being on top. Castes like Peninsulares (born in Spain) and Criollos (their direct descendants) have historically lorded it over castes like the Mestizos (half indigenous) and Mulatos (half African). While the caste system is nowhere near as enforced today, there are apparently very exclusionist Spanish enclaves in Yucatan and other parts of Mexico that exclude others from their chuches and neighbourhoods. Of course, if you know much about the slave trade up in the USA, you'll know that they had the same stupid, racist caste distinctions, but they were less a hierarchical pyramid and more of a bar checking whether you could be a slave or not. If you're ever watching a period drama and you hear words like 'octoroon', you'll understand it's broadly the same thing.</p>
                            <img src={Day1Pic6} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                            <p>We arrived and made our way through a small complex where the vendors were very eager to sell hats to counteract the lack of sun cover in the main compound. Within ten minutes of ticket processing we were through, where we were met by a local tour guide. He was a proud Mayan, and his ancestors probably worked very hard to keep Spanish DNA out of their bloodline, which during the formative years of New Spain was more a matter of personal defense than simple partner choice. He took us into the main compound and there it was, bang ahead of us - the temple that everyone - myself included before I visited - thinks is Chich&eacute;n Itz&aacute; itself. In actual fact, it's the Temple of Kukulcan and Chich&eacute;n Itz&aacute; is the city itself, but that's not what you're thinking when you see it.</p>
                            <img src={Day1Pic7} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                            <p>It's very easy to be taken in by the grandeur of it. It's huge, first and foremost, and made with an ordered craftmanship that matches anything you'll see in Giza. But of course, like everything we saw, it's not a pyramid; pyramids are built as a tomb. It's a temple to living gods, not to mention the home of the high priest. You used to be able to climb up it, but then a couple of things happened: People started to chip away at the temple with their pocket knives (the scum) and a Canadian woman fell to her death from the top. It would have been amazing to see the jungle from up there, but it's not particularly safe, and we'd much prefer that the temple stands undamaged for another millennium so that countless more people can see it and keep the Mayan culture alive than get a nice photo op.</p>
                            <img src={Day1Pic8} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                            <p>He next took us to the ballcourt, and here's where my only pre-existing knowledge comes in. You see, the Mayans played an early version of basketball, with a large stone ring being a sort of vertical hoop either side. You're able to use any part of your body - feet, knees, elbows, hips, and more - to bounce the ball to your team mates, and eventually, to your teammate on the raised platform on your side so they can go for a throw to the hoop. Pretty simple, but there's a lot more to it than that. You see, at the end of the game, one of the teams gets sacrificed. I'd assumed based on my prior reading that it was always the losing team, which seemed to make sense to me - I think football would be a lot more interesting if each team knew they faced being chopped to bits if they lost. But the truth is that in many cases, it was the winners that were sacrified.</p>
                            <img src={Day1Pic9} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />                            
                            <p>You might be thinking that if you were playing any sort of sport where winning you would give you a painful death, you'd do your utmost to throw the game like Marcellus Wallace was waiting outside our locker room. But the truth is, being sacrificed to the gods was in many instances a huge honour, and a way to avoid a one-way ticket to the underworld. You see, despite being from two different continents and living aeons apart, the Aztecs and Mayans had a very similar afterlife concept to the Norse. In Norse myth, you are sent to Valhalla if you die honourably in battle, but you went to the underworld if you died of old age. It's very similar in Aztec and Mayan religion; the only differences being that you can equally get into the best afterlife by being a worthy sacrifice, and your host; in Norse tradition you're going to be spending some time with Hel, the beautiful and gothic goddess of the underworld, but in Aztec myth you're under the thumb of Mictlantecuhtli who is a terrifying skeletal figure whose liver hangs nauseatingly from the bottom of his spinal chord.</p>
                            <p>So if you're a Mayan noble, you can expect to get sacrificed in the event of a win, but if you're a prisoner of war, losing will see you on the chopping block. The ballgames are fascinating, and what's amazing is that the tradition (minus the bloody aftermath) has been restarted by dedicated ballplayers in the last couple of years. Whatever you can say about the Mayan culture, with its limitless brutality, strong social inequality and more, it didn't deserve obliteration at the hands of Cortes, Coronados and their ilk, and it's great to see it still be celebrated.</p>
                            <p>We explored the complex, seeing all sorts of residences and fascinating smaller temples. Our new guide gave us all the key information before letting us explore freely. By the time it was time to go we'd seen every inch of the place, and had bought a couple of souvenirs from the vendors that were everywhere here.</p>
                            <p>We napped on the coach back to Cancun, then asked the driver to drop us off in the middle of the tourist zone rather than going straight to the bus stop. We were hungry. We'd booked into a seafood restaurant but were already late - but luckily the place seemed to be empty. It was right in the middle of the party zone, and we got our first look at the place we'd be going to on our last night; Cocobongo, the famous Cancun nightclub. The music was absolutely pounding, and we were glad that it got slightly cut off by the glass doors into the seafood place.</p>
                            <p>We were very interested in the ceviche, which is very famous in Mexico and Latin America. If you're Steph and you're reading this, you can skip to the next paragraph, but if you're a friend or family member we've shared this with that doesn't know about it, ceviche is a way of enjoying seafood functionally raw; you cure it in lemon juice, which provides the absolute bare minimum of 'cooking' a dish and gets rid of the bacteria. It's delicious, fresh and flavoursome, and this place's variant was absolutely fantastic. But we tried something else here, and it would be something that we'd be enjoying a lot in Mexico; Micheladas.</p>
                            <p>Steph had heard about Micheladas in a Netflix show she'd watched about Mexican cuisine. They are an absolutely delicious beer cocktail that could reductively be described as a beer margarita. On the rim is a mix of tajin (a chili spice mix) and chamoy, a rich umami sauce very popular in Mexico. Mixed with the beer itself are all sorts of flavours; tamarind, soy sauce, Maggi sauce, Worcester sauce, or peppers. Its an absolutely delicious drink, and it's mixed with sweet or savoury snacks. We shared the ceviche and had a michelada each, which contained accompaniments like prawns and nuts. We were quite full by the end, and while the place had been deserted by the time we got in, it was very happening by the time we were done, with a band that we enjoyed listening to.</p>
                            <img src={Day1Pic10} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                            <p>We walked around twenty minutes back to our hotel. Tomorrow, we'd be beginning a new chapter to our holiday; the resort. We'd go over in the morning and start ingratiating ourselves into resort life until we flew to Mexico City.</p>
                            <p>We got another easy night's sleep, thankfully unaffected by jetlag.</p>

                            <p>I can take a sort of sense of pride in these journals in that, even in our downtime, we've given every day its own entry. Of course, that's not to say that every day we've been on holiday I've put into the journal; I know in my heart of hearts that I'll never write a journal now for Cuba, Italy, Norway, Iceland, Turkey, or Germany. But of the holidays that I've documented, even the days that had the most downtime have their own entry.</p>
                            <p>When it comes to our four days in the Royalton resort, I'm at a loss. I simply have to combine these days in order to have something to write about. Because or those four days, we lived the easiest life imaginable. We had the easiest schedule in the world; wake up at some indeterminate point before 10am, head to one of the fine restaurants for breakfast, head down to the beach, sunbathe, swim in the sea, drink cocktails, nap, shower, eat dinner, watch the entertainment, more cocktails, bed, rinse and repeat.</p>
                            <p>We kept fairly lubricated throughout, but we were slightly wary because of the first afternoon. We'd failed to realise the effect the cocktails were having on us. Steph was definitely worse for wear, but I was absolutely catatonic, to the point that a wheelchair was offered when Steph went to be shown the room! I'd been chatting to a guy from Coventry who was staying at a nearby hostel but pretended to be a guest when I completely blacked out, and didn't wake up for several hours. It taught us to handle the free-flowing cocktails with caution, and apart from the last night, we finished each evening tipsy at best.</p>
                            <img src={ResortPic1} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                            <p>The cocktails had an impressive range. We'd primarily dived into margaritas and other tequila cocktails, but they also made rum and other spirit cocktails. Food-wise, we were well--served; we had four restaurants to choose from, each delicious. There was a Mexican place, a buffet, a pan-Asian place, and a steakhouse. We went to each of of these across our four nights and defaulted to the buffet or the Mexican for breakfast.</p>
                            <p>Life was good. I did unfortunately get a bit ill, either as a result of the sunburn or the air conditioning. When it had happened in Japan the same time last year I'd considered it the height of unfairness, but this time I understood. Because for the last two years, prompted mainly by my company's annual leave, we'd gone away across the April bank holidays. And I believe fully that the reason I get ill is because I go straight to an extremely hot, humid country straight from winter and early spring, which in the UK averages out at fifteen degrees or less.</p>
                            <img src={ResortPic2} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                            <p>So I get an unholy combination of a bad throat from the powerful aircon, fluey symptoms from sunburn, streaming eyes and nose from the pollen, and general malaise from the humidity. I also recognised a couple of random symptoms returning from Japan like loss of appetite and the shivers. It passes, but I don't think I'm the easiest to handle when I'm at my worst with it.</p>
                            <p>We kept mostly to ourselves in those few days, but we did speak to a few people. We got on well with Pablo, the guy at the towel stand, and our concierge Samara, though she's much more customer-focused so there may have been an element of 'working' us. Guest wise, there were only two sets of guests we chatted to for more than a few minutes. The first were English, and they'd been everything I'd feared when considering a resort holiday. They were from Luton, first and foremost, which is enough grounds for a restraining order in my book. The wife never stopped talking and the husband never started. They'd been at the resort for two weeks with only minimal trips to the outside world, a feat of inertia I wouldn't have thought possible outside of some species of barnacle. But this wasn't their worst crime against humanity; that came in the admission that they didn't even like Mexican food. What possessed them to come here as opposed to, say, Benidorm I don't know, but they were here and determined to chat to everyone misfortunate enough to make eye contact with them. The woman also said that Steph &quot;didn't look English&quot; but she immediately followed up by saying that &quot;neither did she&quot; as she was Bengali and Jewish. Could have fooled me - I would have gone with &quot;white but too much sun&quot;.</p>
                            <img src={ResortPic3} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                            <p>The second group we met were much more our speed. They were Americans from Texas, and we bonded over music choices during a concert that was being played on the entertainment stage. They were a couple, Dan and Amanda, and their friend Chad. They were in their late forties and all worked in natural gas. Steph chatted to the couple and I chatted to Chad.</p>
                            <p>For some reason, whenever I chat to an American guy over drinks, he always ends up baring his soul to me. I remember the guy who took all of three minutes to tell me he was in Vegas to search the morgues for his drug-addict sister who he suspects came to the city to die. In Chad's case, he had a lot of self-loathing and lack of confidence issues, despite being a manager of a great team for a successful company. Tipsy enough to speak plainly, I gave him some general advice - you're too hard on yourself, Dunnings-Kruger is the curse of successful people, that sort of thing. He ate it up, acting like I was importing vital truths and seeming to brighten up considerably, and shaking my hand every two minutes. If I'm being slightly unfair, I'd say part of the reason my generic, untherapeutic advice ('you're doing great by those kids', 'you should be proud of your service', 'I'm sure your sister will turn up just fine') seems to go down like such as truth bomb is that Americans are much better at venting their problems than listening and giving advice.</p>
                            <p>We took the party to the rooftop where our friends had a cabana - these guys were not averse to additional expenditure. They ordered so many drinks, from Patr&oacute;n to goddamn Veuve Clicquot - whom we'd been lucky enough to visit back in Rennes - which was insane considering that regular drinks, including cocktails, were included. We got drunk and hung out in the cabana - I honestly can't remember what we talked about, but the thing I remember is that they are coming to London in a couple months and we may have definitely offered them a place to stay.</p>
                            <p>And with that, our few days of idle excess were over. They'd gone too quick, but we'd been glad of the lazy break. Tomorrow it was off to Mexico City. To the culture. To the actual Mexican people I'd spent most of the holiday so far with fellow tourists, and I was eager for a break, and I think Steph - though she's now very eager to go back to Cancun - felt the same.</p>

                            <p>6am in a resort has a bit of a strange, liminal quality. The lobby, normally a bustling place where people can thread in and out of the beach, the bars, and the restaurants, is empty, staffed only by a skeleton staff and devoid of customers. People do party the night away here, so it's the rough spot between the people stumbling back to their rooms at 3am and the march of the sunbed snatchers at around 8.</p>
                            <p>We were getting a minibus to the airport. There were about six other people on it, and we trundled in with that sort of early morning, hungover haze that is felt on airport runs all over the resort world. Today we were going to Mexico City. But no one calls it Mexico City. Instead it's Ciudad de M&eacute;xico, shortened most commonly as CDMX. Do you want amazing food, great culture and fantastic colonial architecture? CDMX gon' give it to ya. I'm here all week, folks.</p>
                            <p>One thing I noticed about CDMX airport is that it's insanely close to the city center. When you go to Gatwick or Heathrow, you get this feeling of being far away from central London, but in the case of Benito Juarez, it's basically a five minute cab ride away. We had a bit of initial awkwardness finding the right exit for the Uber but then we were set off, zipping through CDMX on a hot dusty day.</p>
                            <p>Within 20 minutes we were at our hotel, a place with a hostel vibe (an actual hostel, not the movie) but with a big enough room even if we were in two smallish, horizontal bunks separated by a wooden bar that took up all the space of an armrest. It had all the hallmarks of a city break hotel; very little pretense, bright, contrasting colours, and a very modernist shower.</p>
                            <p>Not that we knew the finer details of the room yet, because we'd arrived at half two and the woman on duty had informed us - curtly - that the room wasn't ready yet. We dropped off our suitcases then went exploring down the road. We'd had no food on the flight and were peckish, and it didn't take us long to find what we wanted - birria tacos.</p>
                            <img src={Day4Header} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                            <p>Birria is a delicious broth that you have alongside equally-delicious tacos. You can pour the broth on top, you can dip the taco in; it's designed for customisable eating, and it's absolutely amazing. We found a couple of seats in a little restaurant the size of an off-license, eating with the locals and watching the world go by.</p>
                            <img src={Day4Pic1} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />                         
                            <p>We finished, checked in, and had a quick unpack before opting for a walk. We were going to the Medellin Market, which has nothing to do with Pablo Escobar or his choice of merchandise and everything to do with the freshest produce you can get in the city. Chefs all over the city shop there, and if there's anything food-wise you can't get there, it's probably not worth getting.</p>
                            <img src={Day4Pic2} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>It was around a twenty minute walk to Medellin, and we took it easy, checking out the city center as we went. There was a large cross-section of chilis we wanted to buy so we could prepare birria and everything else we wanted back home, but there was a lot more that was on the shopping list and that Steph was very eager to get her chef's hands on. Chief among them were guajillo chilis, and I'm glad that we asked the right person about it. They didn't have them, but they directed us to the perfect market stall, and its stallholder Carlos.</p>
                            <img src={Day4Pic3} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />                            
                            <p>Carlos was the perfect person to help a couple of tourists who wanted everything. He spoke great English and was a born salesman. Normally when you say that about someone it calls to mind a snake-oil salesman that you can't trust as far as you can throw. But he's that other kind, that honest trader who genuinely loves what they do and gets some sort of genuine buzz from matching customers to what they need that salary workers in our dull apathy couldn't hope to understand. He was quick to listen to whatever we needed, including samples, and the best part was that he gives his Whatsapp number out so that people can ask him for his advice on the recipes he buys the ingredients for!</p>
                            <img src={Day4Pic4} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />                            
                            <p>He also gave us the opportunity to try <i>chapulines</i>, ie grasshoppers. We'd read beforehand that insects are quite a big part of Mexican street food cuisine, but save for some insect pasta we hadn't had any insects before. It was tasty - a bit of an odd sensation, but they'd spiced it right, and it's not really much different to eating mammal meat.</p>
                            <img src={Day4Pic5} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>What's more, the prices were so much lower than what we thought that I can't think of any of it that we could have haggled on in any sort of conscience. We tipped him in the end; it was the least we could do for such amazing service. We walked through the streets of downtown CDMX in the early evening sun, wanting to check out the nightlife. Our walk took us to a gorgeously colonial part of Doctores just north of where we were staying in Roma Sur. We found a cool-looking place called Bar Las Brujas - the Witch Bar. It was an extremely happening place. The best part of it was that the cocktail menu was in the form of a comic book all about women in the Americas who have either practiced witchcraft or been accused of it, and who'd done interesting things. I knew one of these - Marie Laveau, the voodoo queen of New Orleans. We had a few of these lovely cocktails as well as snacks, but we weren't hungry enough for a proper dinner. We headed back to our horizontal bunks and got some sleep.</p>

                            <p>We woke up bright and early at just after 7. We had to get up, grab some early breakfast, and head out to the town center, where we'd be meeting the bus for today's excursion. Today, we were going to see a few highlights we'd wanted to check out all in one. There was the Casa Azul, the home and studio of the artist Frida Kahlo and her husband, Diego Rivera. There was the Mexico City University Campus, a brutalist classic full of murals by Rivera and other key artists. And there was Xochimilco, the series of canals that intersect the city and that feature colourful barges doing the equivalent of what Cambridge students do when they operate punts.</p>
                            <p>We left at 8am, taking a 15 minute walk to the MIGA cafe between our Roma Norte and Juarez (the neighbourhood, not the violent northern city) where we were meeting our bus. From the excursion to Chich&eacute;n Itz&aacute; we assumed there'd be like twenty other people, but the absolute mob we were greeted with was quite striking. There must have been a hundred people there, and we were in the back of the line. We were divided between two buses, and we found it impossible to get seats together. Steph was seated next to a cheerful, friendly slightly older Mexican woman, and I was sat next to Hugo.</p>
                            <img src={Day5Pic1} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>Hugo was Argentinian, and a very interesting guy, but an odd duck. We didn't speak straight away, more of a nod, and I wouldn't learn his name until the afternoon. He used to make all sorts of strange noises as the bus drove along; throat-clears, grunts, and various unpleasant noises. He also tended to run cold, putting a jumper on and turning both of our air con nozzles off before I politely turned mine back on and angled it more in my direction. But I'd come to learn that he was a good guy and I'd enjoy his company greatly later on.</p>
                            <img src={Day5Pic2} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>Our first stop was the town center of Coyocan, the upscale neighbourhood in CDMX where Frida Kahlo lived and spent her formative years. It's an artsy, colonial neighbourhood, harking right back to the 'glory' days of New Spain. We went to a churro place that was one of the oldest establishments of its kind in the city, and from the classical courtyard in muted cream colours, it showed. We ordered a bunch of churros in chocolate sauce, the classic recipe, and devoured them happily outside.</p>
                            <img src={Day5Pic3} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>We explored around slightly, but didn't have long. We met in the main plaza of Coyocan and walked the short distance to the Casa Azul, or the Blue House: Frida and Diego's primarly residence.</p>
                            <img src={Day5Pic4} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>Now, I'm not ashamed to admit it: if it wasn't for the Salma Hayek film, I'd never have known about Frida Kahlo, and we wouldn't have given the Casa Azul as much prominence - to our detriment. The attendance figures before and after the film back this up too.</p>
                            <img src={Day5Pic6} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>As soon as we saw the house, we saw where it got its name. The house is a deep, dark shade of navy that looks almost cartoonish when contrasted with the muted pastels of its colonial neighbours. It's a large house, a whole compound in of itself. The queue was short and we stepped into a bright, flowery courtyard with a concrete reproduction of a Aztec temple and the main house occupying half of the overall compound. We went through the house, seeing prints made by the artist as well as information snippets on her life.</p>
                            <img src={Day5Pic7} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>Museums devoted to artists don't always have the most glowing things to say about their subjects. The Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam, for instance, may as well have hung a sign above the entrance saying &quot;this guy was a leech&quot; withe amount of attention they paid to the fact that he mooched off of the people in his life. But the Casa Azul speaks of Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera with a sort of sweet sentimentality that really makes you think positively of the life they shared together and the impact of their art. It also totally steamrolls through the parts of their relationship that were less savoury, like the 21 year age gap.</p>
                            <img src={Day5Pic10} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>We found out lots of details of Frida's life, like the tram accident that gave her lifelong injuries at sixteen (the poor girl had her <i>uterus</i> pierced by a steel bar) and the couple's fascinating circle of international friends. We saw the house's kitchen, several reception rooms, and their bedrooms. But it wasn't until we got to the top floor, a sort of archive and study, that we saw her ashes contained within a bizarre urn. We'd never seen a museum to a person that features their ashes before. We got outside and saw a video showing some footage of the couple, and I noticed a familiar face - Leon Trotsky.</p>
                            <img src={Day5Pic11} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>As I've explained to Steph before, my historical brain isn't an endless fountain of knowledge. I'm not one of those guys who can endlessly reel off facts in general conversation and who starts off sentences with &quot;Well, in the immortal words of Pliny the Elder&quot;. My knowledge - and I'll be stuck up and say it's pretty deep - is like a long room full of tiny lockboxes. If you unlock the box, the contents will spill out in a barely-articulated machine gun fire of pure autism, but otherwise, it'll stay firmly locked up.</p>
                            <img src={Day5Pic12} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>So Leon Trotsky's life in Mexico was a lockbox that the video had just opened. I've always had an interest in Trotsky. He was one of Lenin's top proteges during the Bolshevik era and one of the best ideological thinkers the party had. But he messed up one major job that Lenin had assigned to him - stop Stalin seizing power. Stalin steamrolled him and took the top slot, sending Leon running to Mexico. For years he lived in Mexico City, hobnobbing with the intellectual elite - Frida and Diego, it seems, included! Then, a KGB asset in Mexico put an icepick through his head.</p>
                            <img src={Day5Pic13} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>I found out that Leon Trotsky's house was only about twenty minutes walk away - and that's one thing I would have loved to see if we weren't on an excursion. But we moved on. Our next stop was the National Autonomous University of Mexico campus, with vast, sweeping murals done by Diego Rivera and other artists. It's a superbly brutalist but not in the purely functional way that I hate.</p>
                            <img src={Day5Header} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>The most impressive mural wasn't by the disturbingly Nabokovian Rivera, however. It was <i>Representaci&oacute;n Hist&oacute;rica de la Cultura</i> by Juan O'Gorman. This huge mural essentially covers all four sides of a major campus building, and depicts the entirety of Mexican history, from the pre-Columbian period, through to the conquests of Cortes, Coronados and their ilk, through to the many formative years of New Spain then the new Mexican Empire and after. It's very impressive, both in the artistry and the sheer scale</p>
                            <img src={Day5Pic16} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>The campus itself was impressive. Students were debating, sketching still lifes, and doing spoken word. We headed back to the bus and went on to our major destination: Xochimilco. This is the part of CDMX that is the leftover from when CDMX used to be a set of lakes. The neighbourhood is intersected with canals and floats that operate in the exact same way punts in Cambridge do, except they have bright colours that make their float stand out. These are neonish colours that look like a cross between the Ultimate Warrior's wrestling costume and the film <i>Batman Forever</i>.</p>
                            <img src={Day5Pic17} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>We started drinking fairly early on; the canal has plenty of boat-based Michelada sellers. An American couple on the other side helped us order and soon we were chatting away about the only thing that is guaranteed to keep the conversation flowing on what is essentially a drinking expedition; talking about other famous drinking stories we've had. Of course, the conversation progressed and soon we were talking about - of all things - DB Cooper, which of course prompted me to go into the 'Tommy Wiseau is DB Cooper' theory I've heard a few times. We probably spent an hour talking to them both on the boat and in the little stopping area in the middle.</p>
                            <img src={Day5Pic18} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>But they were sitting in a different part of the coach, and more to the point, Hugo was now feeling chatty. He told me about his trip so far and I told him about ours. He was keen to talk politics and history but I don't know much about Argentinian history except for Galtieri, and that's not a topic a Brit typically talks to an Argentinan about. He'd spent some time in Chile, and I'd noticed that the Casa Azul was on Allende Avenue, so I talked about Salvador Allende and that seemed to keep the conversation going.</p>
                            <p>We got off the bus and headed for a bite to eat. We headed to the Cantina la Riviera de Sur in Roma Norte. I had Tacos Chomoros, ie flavoured with chamoy, and Steph had lime soup. It was getting late so we took an Uber back and crashed out.</p>

                            <p>Day Nine was a classic Neil and Steph city break. No excursions, no laying on a beach, just us and the best food, museums and culture the city had to offer. We grabbed a quick breakfast and headed out, getting an Uber over to our first stop, Chapultepec Castle.</p>
                            <img src={Day6Header} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>Chapultepec is a large hill and nature area on the edge of the city, and it's where many of the major tourist attractions are. The castle is a large, European-style palace with amazing views of the surrounding city.</p>
                            <img src={Day6Pic1} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>Chapultepec was designed for, and partially by, Maximilian I, Emperor of Mexico for a very short time in the 1860s. And therein lies a tale. You see, after the Mexicans threw the Spanish out they got a touch of the imperial fever, going against the idea of setting up a Bolivar-style republic and setting up a European-style monarchy in its place. That gave way to a republic after a short time, and stayed that way until the 1860s, when the new republic got into financial trouble and decided they weren't fussed about paying their debts to France and other European powers. </p>
                            <img src={Day6Pic2} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>France, under Napoleon's nephew, decided that a clear and rational course of action would be an invasion and a forced reinstatement of the Mexican monarchy. Only this time, they didn't have a Mexican in mind. They were looking for a European who could be their puppet as they kept a tight grip on the country; colonialism in practice but not name.</p>
                            <img src={Day6Pic3} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>They decided on Maximilian, a Habsurg archduke, who probably couldn't have been a worse choice. He didn't speak a word of Spanish. He was used to the chilly Austrian climate. And he knew nothing about Mexico, its culture or its people. The republican factio led by the deposed president had no trouble gaining popular support against him, and within three years he was ousted and executed.</p>
                            <img src={Day6Pic4} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>Chapultepec, naturally, outlasted him. It's now a heritage site featuring a museum about Mexican history. We made a rough trek up the hill, the sun already blazing overhead, and stood in a short queue. We got inside to the beautiful main courtyard featuring peaceful gardens, also featuring a commanding view.</p>
                            <img src={Day6Pic5} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>The museum was very informative and traced a gradual path throughout the history of New Spain and thereafter. We started off with a set of murals; Aztec imagery, revolutionary leaders such as Pancho Villa, Emiliano Zapata, and various moments in history.</p>
                            <img src={Day6Pic6} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />                                  
                            <p>The best of these was a huge mural of Mexico City of the 1700s across a large wooden screen. It was amazing in its scale and intricate detail, both in the city streets and the surrounding canals.</p>
                            <img src={Day6Pic18} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />                                 
                            <p>Another major highlight was the original 1824 Declaration of Independence, which I naturally enthused about quite a lot. That enthusiasm caught the attention of a couple of students from Veracruz who were curious about my interest. One thing I didn't pick up on is that (and Steph noticed that, so I'm not being bigheaded) they also had a bit of a crush.</p>
                            <img src={Day6Pic21} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />           
                            <p>But I was happy to chat, and they introduced me to their tutor, who was an English tutor but a real Mexican history expert. He was a nice guy too, and on hearing that he knew his stuff, I decided I wanted to take advantage and ask a question. I'm proud of the question, too. I asked him why Mexico didn't follow the Bolivarian (I actually used the word) model after independence and form a republic. He told me - it's because of the conservative faction of the post-imperial period had a lot of power and didn't want a republic. We chatted for about half an hour, his students listening, interested. I feel bad though, as they missed the bulk of their tour as a result.</p>
                            <img src={Day6Pic22} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>So we slipped away and finished the four, then took a walk over to our next stop, the National Anthropology Museum. This is an absolutely unparalled collection of pre-Columbian artefacts, split among different cultures and eras. We saw the same students as we got inside, as well as their tutor once we got through, but we didn't want to bother them anymore.</p>
                            <p>Every department in the museum is all centered around the main atrium, which has an eyecatching water feature, a large central tower that creates a constant three-sixty waterfall. We navigated around, heading first to the Aztec section.</p>
                            <p>The Aztecs have always ben a bit of a blind spot for me history-wise, and what I did know, I now know to be mostly wrong. Like the Mayans, their culture is tremendously violent, true, but it was also vastly more advanced than its neighbours above and below Mexico. A great way to highlight that is two major exhibits of the section. The first is a reproduction of the main facade Temple of the Feathered Serpent at Teotihuacán. Now Teotihuacán wasn't built by the Aztecs, but the temple reconstruction is in very Aztec design, so I think the conclusion was that this was added during the Aztec occupation.</p>
                            <img src={Day6Pic10} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>It's an incredibly colourful, vibrant and well-constructed facade, and has these impressive murals of crocodiles and other animals. It's an extremely impressive structure, looking like something you'd expect to see in Ephasus or Pompeii.</p>
                            <img src={Day6Pic11} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>The other exhibit <i>is</i> fully Aztec in its construction, and it's one of the most famous structures in the world - the Aztec Sunstone. This is a huge - gargantian - rounded stone tablet, exquisitely carved with ornate patterns. It was primarily for worship, and based on what the information said I'm surprised that it wasn't painted red. You'd get Jaguar warriors dueling on top of it, with the loser's blood caking the thing. It was a very common sacrificial altar, but I imagine it would have been cleaned thoroughly inbetween.</p>
                            <img src={Day6Pic24} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>The Olmecs were next. The literal only thing I know about the Olmecs is that they carved giant heads, and I only know that because I remember the Simpsons episode where Mr Burns gets the family a giant Olmec head as a gift ("No Maggie, not Aztec, Olmec!"). Sure enough, the star attraction was a giant head, carved with impressive detail. It was very Easter Island-esque, and I can imagine that while the two cultures would never have met, they would have been used for the same purpose.</p>
                            <img src={Day6Pic25} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>The Mayan section was impressive too, and had its own temple, a grand, fully intact construction that looks both impressive and, frankly, foreboding.</p>
                            <img src={Day6Pic26} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />      
                            <p>After a few hours, we'd done the bulk of the collection, and wanted to stop for lunch. We went to a food truck and got a couple of local sandwiches, before getting an Uber to our next stop, the Artesans' Market. The market is the best stop for art and handicrafts in the city. We explored the stalls, looking for some souvenirs for us and the family. We bought some amazing Aztec prints that were made on site; one for us and one for my mum, as well as a pipe for my dad, and a serving plate and cup for John and Michele.</p>
                            <p>It was early evening by this point, so we dropped the stuff off back in the room and headed out to eat. We found a place in Roma Norte with outside seating and a decent wine list. It also, interestingly, had insect tacos. We'd had grasshoppers back at the food market, but this was a step up. There was scorpion, (as in a whole scorpion in a taco) carpenter ants, and most nauseatingly, escamoles, which is buttered <i>ant larvae</i>. Any one of them would have been unique, but I wanted something at least I knew I liked, so I ordered the grasshopper tacos and Steph got a raw fish tacos. Steph didn't like hers and mine came absolutely loaded with grasshoppers, making it quite unpleasant to eat.</p>
                            <p>We drank some wine and took a quick walk back, ready for our next day of city exploration.</p>
                        </div>}
                    
                        <div onClick={expandDay7} id="day7ExpanderMorMex" className="headings">

                        {day7 && <div className="days" id="day7">
                            <p>This was one of our only full, start-to-finish days in CDMX, and we were determined to make it count. We had a few points to hit in the city and wanted to leave at least semi-early in order to fit it all in.</p>
                            <p>Our first stop was something I'd been banging on about since I'd heard about it - the Mercado de Sonora, or Witch's Market. This is the biggest occult market in CDMX and probably one of the biggest in the world. We grabbed a quick hotel breakfast and headed out, wandering the streets in the vague direction of the market.</p>
                            <p>The Mercado de Sonora doesn't look anything like an occult market should look like. You expect something similar to Knockturn Alley from Harry Potter, with dark alcoves and sinister potions bubbling away in the darkness. In reality, it's a series of aluminiumn warehouses in a tight compound, each packed very tightly with different stalls.</p>
                            <p>We started and finished our exploration with a simple mistake; going to the animal part yet. There's a large animal market at Sonora. Some of them are sold for meat, others as pets, and others for sacrifice. Animal sacrifice sounds like such a pulp horror topic, but it's a major aspect of Santeria, a major Latin-American folk religion that has some commonalities with Voodoo. You'd never think based on life in the UK that animal sacrifices would be a key part of life in certain regions in 2025, but it's a serious business.</p>
                            <p>It reminded us of the meat market in Fez, with the exception that a higher number of animals were alive - but smelt otherwise. The smell, plus the clutter and general unsanitary feeling, was overpowering, and we got the hell out of there as soon as we could. Would I have wanted to go back and buy a voodoo doll or a spellbook? Sure. Would I have waded through another single row of the animal market in order to do so? No.</p>
                            <img src={Day7Pic1} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />       
                            <p>There were, however, a number of gem stalls outside of the main market and we shopped for some gems for Michele with her on the line. We chose a medium-size handful of (artificial) gemstones both for Michele and for the house. </p>
                            <img src={Day7Pic2} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />       
                            <p>Our next stop was one of CDMX's unmissable sites: the Templo Mayor, one of the only remaining traces of the original Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, which lies where the modern city stands. Of course, as I mentioned before, CDMX used to be a series of lakes, and Tenochtitlan was very much a Venice-type city. The Templo Mayor (main temple) covers a large chunk of the city's historical quarter (or one historical quarter; the other being Chapultepec) and was visible from street level.</p>
                            <img src={Day7Pic3} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />       
                            <p>The historical center was busy today; there was some sort of parade or festival going on, and the crowds were tightly penned in. We made our way through with some difficulty and queued up at the temple entrance, where you could still see a section of the temple itself. The Templo Mayor is visibly similar to the other temples we'd seen and would be seeing, with its thick square buttresses and distinctive sheer edges, but it had a much different construction setup. While they'd been made of smoothed stone, this had a much more igneous feel. It's made of these thick, reddish, possibly volcanic stones with some sort of white ceramic moulding. We got through and started exploring the temple grounds via a raised wooden platform that intercut the temple walls.</p>
                            <img src={Day7Pic4} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />       
                            <p>It's impressive in both its size and its detail. While Chichen Itza is tall, Templo Mayor is wide, and looks more impressive for it. It's also a very unique place in terms of building. The temples of Tenochtitlan, and Teotihuacán too, started off relatively small and got made bigger along the way. How was this achieved, you might ask? Simple. By building over the initial shell no more than around a meter thicker each time. Each temple is like a nesting doll with several different layers built on top. Did they use the building materials from the inner layers to add to the outer layer? Nope. Nor was the actual interior temple particularly used for anything, as all the worship was commenced on the exterior platforms. It seems a novel, if wasteful, building method, and thanks to strategic gaps made in the temples, you could see the telltale signs of this process having taken place several times.</p>
                            <img src={Day7Pic5} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />       
                            <p>We walked through the temple grounds and saw the various rooms (though they were rooms in the same way that the Sims rooms are when you delete the ceiling accidentally) that were part of it, from sacrificial halls to the priests' quarters. Once you get through the main temple you also get access to the Templo Mayor museum, which is much more expansive and has lots of different exhibitions.</p>
                            <img src={Day7Pic6} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />       
                            <p>We saw some amazing exhibits, but the number one is the Coyolxauhqui Stone. It depicts the goddess Coyolxāuhqui and was used as a sacrificial stone similar to the Sunstone. There are also lots of statues, such as the aforementioned Mictlantecuhtli with his liver hanging from the bottom of his spinal chord and other Aztec gods, such as Quetzalcōātl. Quetzalcōātl is the Aztec wind god, but he's been worshipped through cross-cultural exchange all over Mesoamerica. </p>
                            <img src={Day7Pic7} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />       
                            <p>We explored the rest of the collection and got out back into the heritage quarter. We had an excursion for this afternoon that I in particular was looking forward to: A Lucha Libre event. Lucha Libre is the colourful, masked form of high-flying wrestling that is phenomenally popular in Mexico. When I was into wrestling, my main knowledge of Lucha Libre came in the form of Ray Mysterio Junior, the man, the myth, the legend. And while I'd never watched it directly, I was definitely a big supporter of high-flying wrestling.</p>
                            <img src={Day7Pic8} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />       
                            <p>Steph had known next to nothing about the sport and had little interest in wrestling, but was excited after reading into it more. We had a meet and greet with food with an actual luchador including complimentary beer and mezcal, the latter I was more interested in, before getting to see part of a show. We had a little bit of time so we headed up to a nearby rooftop terrace for a beer. CDMX is a city of rooftop terraces. It wasn't too dissimmilar to Fez and Marrakech, but while those tended to be more classic rooftops, the ones in CDMX are more modern and trendy.</p>
                            <img src={Day7Pic9} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />       
                            <p>We had a beer that we got overcharged for while we got our bearings. The view was fascinating, including the cathedral and most of historic downtown. The crowds down on the ground were just as busy as before, and we checked our maps to ensure we were still making good time. We weren't. We were already running late and Steph was already requesting the Uber before we'd got our bags. We raced to the pickup then kept our eyes on the time as we weaved through traffic. When we got to the drop off site we were in full sprint mode and met the host at the back of the apartment building where the meet and greet was taking place.</p>
                            
                            <p>She led us to the top, us out of breath and apologising profusely, and told us that we weren't the last to arrive. That couple did arrive shortly after, equally out of breath and shamefaced.</p>
                            <p>We were a curious lot up there on the terrace. It was a lovely rooftop garden with creeping vines and an excellent view, and a grand table in the center of the patio where we were sat. Our guide was a short woman that wore VO5 in the same way I do, slicking back short hair that was jet black. She had a huge passion for the sport and was a good host. Then there was an Indian-American family from Chicago and the couple that came afterwards, black Americans who were nice and friendly. Then there was a quiet, friendly guy that looked a bit like a younger Dave Matthews. Then there were the weirdos.</p>
                            <p>I separate out these excursioners because everyone I've described previously was cool and on the level. The weirdos were not. First there was Dave Matthews' girlfriend, an American woman with the most grating accent I've ever heard. She was drunk and talking endlessly about Trump, Ron DeSantis, and Florida. You'd think that her paralysing hatred of Trump would make her less annoying, but I look back at that drunk two hour debate I had in Vegas with the girl who loved him, and while both were very drunk, I actually preferred talking to the Trump supporter. Then there was Marcus. He was a black guy that way overdressed for the climate in a thick hoodie and tracksuit bottoms. He started off quite aloof, not really engaging with anyone. Then I (who was sat next to him) asked a question in the Q&A round that demonstrated at least a basic knowledge of the fundamentals of wrestling and suddenly he was all over me, going on little diatribes about the history of wrestling while we paused for a quick break.</p>
                            <p>Problem was, he kept talking when she resumed her introduction, barely abating until I told him politely that I wanted to listen, which abated him for a while, but not for long. There's more to discuss on Marcus, and our third hitherto unnamed weirdo, but it's an excellent segue into talking about some of the things I learned about Lucha Libre. </p>
                            <p>Lucha Libre is a very traditionalist form of wrestling that eschews the modern trappings of WWE like tables, promos, and steel chairs. In its place is a form of sports entertainment that promotes death-defying stunts and simple dichotomies between good and evil, with the faces being squeaky clean and the heels being Dick Dastardly in a ring. The entire spectacle revolves around the culture of masks. Masks are worn at all times, they keep your identity safe from the public, and removing it is often a gesture of career suicide. The only match in Lucha Libre that doesn't have a predefined outcome is a Mask vs Mask match. And when I say predefined outcome, what I mean is that the wrestlers decide who will win in the ring. Which means a real life shoot fight where both competitors are legitimtely going out there to destroy the other. </p>
                            <p>The host had a fantastic knowledge of Lucha Lbre, but we got a great firsthand view when we met the special guest - a real life Luchador, brother of superstar Luchador Mystico. He was a powerhouse of a dude, not tall but hench, and obviously had an immense strength about him. He told us about the tricks of the trade and the Luchador's life. He told us that he was training his daughters to be Luchadors, at which Marcus chimed in and said that he wouldn't train his daughters to be Luchadors. </p>
                            <p>I soon realised the dude's issue - he was a mysogynist. It became clearer and clearer by the minute, and the thing about girls learning Lucha Libre was definitley a red flag. As it turned out, Steph had clocked it too as he'd been totally uninterested in carrying out a conversation with her. Some people really tell on themselves.</p>
                            <p>What did I say, incidentally, when he said his piece about training your daughters to be Luchadors? He asked me if I'd do that for my daughters and I said "Well yes, if they're hench". We didn't talk so much after that.</p>
                            <img src={Day8Pic16} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />       
                            <p>Despite needing 100% translation, Mystico's brother was a cool guy, and he responded well to both my questions and my brief Spanish courtesies. Throughout the meet and greet we also had lots of mezcal and these strange vegetable tacos, which were nice at first but quickly got bland. We asked for more because we were hungry, but then they got very unpleasant fast. After we were done we went to the show, and were able to enter for the final match. I'm not sure why we only had the final match as part of the package; I feel like maybe the got a special discount. We entered the arena and were joined by a thousand braying, engaged fans. In any other instance a bunch of gringos entering at different points would have drawn attention but their focus was one hundred percent on the ring.</p>
                            <img src={Day7Pic11} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />       
                            <p>The main event was a fatal fourway tag between a face and a heel faction we didn't know. It started off as very much a kerb stomp from the heel team onto one of the faces. Steph asked me why his teammates didn't intervene, and I said that was because you want to make things seem at their lowest ebb before the good guys make a comeback. Think about all the times in the WWE where the face is literally a half second away from the pin when their arm stiffens.</p>
                            <p>Soon enough, the faces rebounded, and the action was intense. One thing we clocked straight away was that Lucha Libre is very heavy on Hurricanranas - which if you're not familiar with Ray Mysterio's moveset is a high flying move where you basically wrap your legs around someone's neck and do a somersault. It was used at least once every few seconds until the faces came out triumphant.</p>
                            <p>We headed out, thinking we'd be rendevouzing with the group, which we didn't. But I still had to wait for Weirdo Number 3 as he had some merch in my rucksack. I haven't mentioned this individual before, but he was quite possibly the biggest weirdo of them all. This was Steve.</p>
                            <p>Steve was a Canadian (another one) with shoulder length hair and a smile that didn't quite reach the eyes. He was one of the more outwardly social people at the table but in all honesty I mark that up as superficial charm. I'd gotten chatting to him because he's from Winnipeg, where the Weakerthans - one of my favourite bands of all time - are from. I asked him if he was a fan and he was, so we spent a bit of time chatting about it.</p>
                            <p>He'd put some merch in my bag, the unspoken declaration of trust as a fellow traveller. As it was I was looking for him afterwards, and shouted out after him when I saw him, making sure he got it. The three of us headed out afterwards and it turned out he got a bad read of Marcus too, not that that excuses him.</p>
                            <p>He seemed cool at first, but Steph soon noticed - and I did, especially when she clued me in - that he was paying hyper focused attention on me.</p>
                            <p>This wasn't like Marcus, not wanting chat to a woman - this dude was hyper focused. We were at a bar but we disentangled outselves, me saying to Steve that he seemed more enamoured with me than Steph. He didn't quite know how to take it, but before long we were away and out into the night. We got some delicous street tacos and headed back to the room.</p>

                                <p>Today was one of our last days in CDMX, one of our last excursions, and one of our last days in Mexico proper. We were headed to Teotihuacán, the great Aztec city in the mountains, one of the most impressive sights in Mesoamerican history.</p>
                                <p>Our day started the same day as our other excursions had - a bright and early wakeup, a quick hotel breakfast then a walk to the MIGA cafe. We were delighted to note that the excursion wasn't as busy as last time, and we were able to get a seat together. It was a large bus and we took off barrelling through CDMX at rush our to our first spot, which is in the historical downtown. It was the Plaza of the Three Cultures, a large square that has architecture from three cultures - Aztec, Spanish, and Mexican. It's fascinating to see them stack on top of each other and a great example of Mexican history in action.</p>
                                <p>Our gudide was a short, quite stern woman who had a keen interest in Teotihuacán's history. She held our attention well, giving us the best information she could cobble together about the city.Teotihuacán</p>
                                <img src={Day8Pic1} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />       
                                <p>We headed to the north of the city to Our Lady of Guadelope. This is a large cathedral and compound of the Catholic church with several gardens, churches and items of interest. As we got in, we saw the main basilica - it's a modernist, dare I say even brutalist, building, with natural acoustic boosting from the paneling by the organs. It's a fascinating building, a real nexus of faith, and the rest of the compound is fascinating too. It also has another large church as part of it that is, and I'm not joking here, sinking. Right now it looks like the leaning tower of Pisa but soon it will have dropped a few inches. It all harks back to CDMX being build on the water, and now it has a good share of buildings that are actively sinking into the mud.</p>
                                <img src={Day8Pic2} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                                <p>Once we'd visited the basilica we headed out of the city. We drove about an hour to an artesans' collective that made every possible use out of agave. They gave us a demonstration of all the things they could make out of agave. The first paper ever used in Mesoamerica was made of agave, and it's like tracing paper. It was used as part of trade, poetry and literature as well as a million other uses. They also told us about pulque, which is a drink made from fermenting agave - which sort of makes it a middlepoint to tequila. We got to try several types of tequila, with their sommelier or whatever the role is called for spirits distributing small sipping shots between us.</p>
                                <img src={Day8Pic3} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                                <img src={Day8Pic5} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                                <p>There was a gift shop on site, and we knew this would be a lot better than what we'd see in town. We, and especially I, wanted more souvenirs for us, and this seemed like a great place. We shopped around and got helped by their staff, and I decided on a guyabara - a bright, airy, caribbean shirt that I'd been trying to get my hands on since Cuba. I bought one that had lattice threads and pockets built into the bottom of the shirt. It's an essential summer top for me and the craftsmanship speaks for itself.</p>
                                <p>We bought it and a few other items and headed out to the restaurant nearby. They have one major USP - they serve molcajete, which is a style of food initially popularised by pre-Columbian peoples. It involves food served in a traditional granite bowl which is fired up on a hob. It's absolutely delicious, and we both munched down before the bus left while watching women perform a wardance in traditional Aztec costumes. It was all for us of course, but it was still very engaging.</p>
                                <img src={Day8Pic9} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                                <p> The bus was very punctual, and our driver made it very clear straight away that she wasn't waiting around for people. We drove just under an hour before we got to Teotihuacán proper.</p>
                                <p>A bit of history about Teotihuacán. Earlier on I alluded to the fact that it's got a lot more to it history-wise than you might think. It's true that the Aztecs used it as a capital and major city for the majority of their reign, but it's the understandable opinion of most people that know about it - as well as historians for decades - that they'd built it too.</p>
                                <img src={Day8Pic11} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                                <p>Not so. The Aztecs discovered the city and contributed to it particularly, but it was actually built by a precursor civilisation. When? Anywhere from 100 to 50BC, or BCE if you're cool like me. This great city was being built when Caesar crossed the Rubicon. It's closer to the Parthenon than Chichén Itzá and unlike Greece and Rome, it didn't have the Meditteranean and a thousand trading links across three continents. Not only would Teotihuacán have been isolated from the type of necessary trading routes needed to produce stone and materials, it's also far from a body of water right in the middle of the high plans. It's nothing short of miraculous, and while less-imaginative minds will jump right to ancient aliens, we have to remind ourselves that the ancient world wasn't ancient in terms of advancement.</p>
                                <img src={Day8Pic12} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                                <p>What adds to the decidedly non-alien mystique is that around a thousand years after it was built, Teotihuacán was abandoned. Historians don't know exactly why but point to internal division. After it got abandoned in about 800 AD, a very small number of people remained, but their descendents were long gone before the Aztecs took the place over in the early 1400s. I can't imagine what it would be like as an Aztec colonist or scout looking to increase your territory in that time. You make your way across the open plans expecting a prairie as far as the eye can see and you stumble across the mostly-intact ruins of an ancient city. It's positively Lovecraftian. </p>
                                <img src={Day8Pic13} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                                <p>We followed a dusty path to the open city remains. I say remains because, while the full city would have been much, much bigger, this place was far from a ruin. Neither of us had any sort of idea of the sheer size of the place before we walked out into the main center.</p>
                                <img src={Day8Pic14} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                                <p>Teotihuacán is huge, and very intact. You can see about twenty temples, all standing strong, down a long main city square that felt lived in. At its center was a large raised platform that was used as a market and an agora. You could imagine it bustling with Pre-Columbian peoples. You imagined yourself browsing the market before going to pray in front of the temple on a sunny afternoon.</p>
                                <img src={Day8Pic15} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                                <p>And sunny it was. It must have been approaching forty degrees, and due to the angles of the temples shade was few and far between. We actually took to standing in the narrow sliver of shade offered in the immediate metre beyond its bottom. Speaking of said tables, they were magnificent - immense structures tougher than bedrock and built to last without a shadow of a doubt. The two main events are the Temple of the Moon in the main square and the Temple of the Sun down a side street. The Temple of the Sun, as you'd imagine based on planetary scale, is a lot bigger than the Temple of the Moon. It's magnificent in its scope and grandeur and incredibly well-preserved.</p>
                                <p>I think Teotihuacán is one of the most amazing sights I've ever seen, and I'm sure the same is true of Steph. It's not just the architectural style, it's the sheer completeness of it. You can go to the Roman Forum, and while it looks and feels authentic and fantastic, you can't imagine walking through it as an ancient Patrician. But you can definitely imagine yourself as a high priest or a member of the nobility strolling through Teotihuacán with your friends, immersed in a culture and a civilisation you don't realise is all too tenuous.</p>
                                <p>We had to head back after, and we walked down a long road lined with a few stalls. We bought a few of our souvenirs, including one I'm looking at riught now, a skeleton married couple in porcelain. It's sweet, and not at all morbid.</p>
                                <p>We were on the coach for a while, waiting for one group. At their head was an influencer - Korean or Japanese most likely - and her crew who'd been taking pictures everywhere. She was slightly overly made up and had an air of self-importance, so we had a fair amount of schadenfreude when our guide announced that we'd be leaving without them. They happened to come around the corner just as the bus was pulling away and everyone got the bus driver's attention as the girls ran hell for leather towards us.</p>
                                <p>We watched the beautiful countryside as we drove back to the city. We hadn't really made any friends today unlike our previous excursions, so there wasn't anyone to make polite conversation with thankfully. We got in well after dark, and though the night wasn't particularly old, we fancied something a bit low key. We grabbed some delicious birria tacos from a street food vendor and bought a few beers from the mercado on the corner. We enjoyed the beers out on the rooftop of our hotel - we got a reasonably good few of the ground a few floors down and had the place to ourselves for the most part. We decided to plan our last day in CDMX. I was, naturally, pushing for a day in the city, and Steph was pushing for an excursion. In the end I was swayed by the one she picked. It was a trip to Tolantongo, featuring amazing, swimmable natural hot springs and an exciting cave system. We sat out for a while then devoured the birria on the little deskette in our apartment.</p>
                                <p>That's where my acount of the night ends, but it wasn't the same for Steph - she was up half the night with diahhrea from the birria!</p>

                                    <p>While we'd already decided to have a quiet evening, it became a necessity once we found out the pickup time for Tolantongo - 4.30 am. We were meeting the guys outside the hotel but we still had to get up insanely early. We got out seamlessly, meeting two guys outside. They just had a car, and we figured they were taking us to the coach.</p>
                                    <p>They weren't. This was the excursion. It was quite a new excursion and the word hadn't gotten out yet, so it was just two of us and two guys in a car. I can't remember their names, but there was a young guide and an older driver. The young guy was quite new but had lots of enthusiasm, the older guy was acting as a sort of mentor to him.</p>
                                    <p>The car didn't have rear seatbelts, which I was nervous about, but I cared less and less about it as we got out of the city and towards the hills. It's a beautiful part of the country, and was punctuated by a beautiful sunrise that lit everything up nicely.</p>
                                    <p>We were getting into the mountains - not hills, mountains. The altitude, and the views, were immense, reminiscent of Austria or Germany but that kept its temperature better.</p>
                                    <p>After a couple of ours we stopped off at a breakfast place. I had Chilaquiles and Steph had Oaxaca cheese quesadillas. I made a faux pas by totally missing the order for coffee with milk - requesting cafe au laut instead of cafe con leche! Breakfast was pretty good and we didn't linger, heading out to Tolantongo proper.</p>
                                    <img src={Day9Pic1} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                                    <p>It's truly magnificent. It's a huge mountain valley with a sheer drop and some of the most magnificent scenery you'll see. Jutting out of the mountainside are these incredible pools that could almost pass for naturally formed. They look incredible, and the view from inside them is even better. Because we jumped straight in. For the first few minutes, it was like a warm bath, but it got cool quickly as our bodies adjusted. It was about 7am at this point, and it was still quite chilly up in the mountains. What I wouldn't have given for these pools back in Teotihuacán, but right now we had to keep moving down to maintain the heat.</p>
                                    <img src={Day9Pic2} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                                    <p>We swam around, taking in the beautiful views, and sunning ourselves as it climbed higher. We got out after about an hour, and proceeded to the next part of the valley - the caves. Tolantongo has an impressive cave system and a good chunk of it is completely swimmable. We headed inside, past a waterfall that was colder than Pluto to warm cave waters. We swam around, exploring the main cavern and the little side areas. We had our phones with us; our guys had provided us with these around-the-neck phone wallets that kept our phones waterproof; I'd been quite suspicious about it firstly but with some gentle prompting from Steph I relinquished my fervent attempts to keep the phone pocket above water. It didn't get a drop on it.</p>
                                    <img src={Day9Pic3} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                                    <p>We proceeded through the cave system, getting further and further away from the main cavern. We found ourselves in another cavern with a large amount of open space separated by a guiding rope. We were unsure why no one was on the other side of the guide rope, but our questions were quickly answered.</p>
                                    <img src={Day9Pic5} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                                    <p>Our older guide flashed a torch at the cavern wall on the other side of the great expanse - and disturbed a colony of bats sleeping upside down. There were dozens of them, each reacting to the torch how Steph does when I switch on the main light when I'm asleep. They did these little defensive swoops in their immediate vicinity before resettling themselves. Me and Steph both dived underwater, not wanting to have to spend £300 on a rabies vaccine. But they didn't go near us - bats aren't stupid. Instead they went back to sleep and we watched them in the darkness after the torch was off.</p>
                                    <p>The next step was just me and the guys. It involved fully diving under a section of rock to get to another small section. Steph found it a bit claustrophobic - both the fact that you're fully submerged under rock, and the fact that the cavern you get to on the other side is pretty tiny. Caves are born claustrophobia machines. All it takes is a picture of John Jones or any of the others stuck fast inside a cave to give me the willies, and that's not even a phobia I have. Of course, caves are also arachnophobia machines, and I have that in spades.</p>
                                    <img src={Day9Pic6} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                                    <img src={Day9Pic17} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                                    <p>After the caves, we headed down to the river at the valley bed. Down where the hot spring pools are, the river looked relatively straightforward, but further down near the caves, it looked entirely different. The river was a vibrant shade of teal which almost looked like it had been engineered, but looked amazingly beautiful in the shimmering sun. We walked down and got in. It was like a bath that you've been in for about an hour but it's still lovely and warm. We swam, we lay under the even hotter waterfalls, and we perched ourselves above the three foot waterfall to the next riverbed, feeling the current desperately trying to move us forward. It was a beautiful, relaxing time, and before we knew it the guys were signalling for us to head out.</p>
                                    <img src={Day9Pic7} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                                    <p>We got a beautiful view of the mountains as we drove away. We got a few amazing photo ops, including when we stopped at a roadside stall for some refreshments. The vendors were selling pulque, that traditional Aztec drink of fermented agave. If you think of beer being like scotch if it was fermented instead of distilled, you'll get the relationship between pulque and tequila. It's sweet and delicious, but as we drove away, we realised that it made you incredibly gassy. We both made pains to fart discreetly as we made our way back into the city, only realising that it was a common symmtom once we were talking about it.</p>

                                    <p>We got back into CDMX late afternoon. It was to be our last evening, and we wanted to make the most of it. But there was business to be done. We had a few more souvenirs to buy, and we didn't fancy our chances of getting anything good once we got back to Cancun. We headed back to the Artisans Market, buying a some more gifts for friends and family as well as us.</p>
                                    <p>We got an Uber from the market to the centre of the historic city centre, to a place I'd been interested in since I'd read about it - La Cantina L'Opera. On the surface of things, La Cantina L'Opera is just a fairly fancy bar to visit before going to an opera. But that's excluding a certain purported event that took place in the 1910s. During the final days of the revolution, Pancho Villa was in CDMX ready for a final push. He was looking for a place for him and his men to get a drink, and stumbled across the cantina. On entering, he was disgusted with the bourgeois sensibilities of the establishment, and chose to express his loyalty for working class watering holes by shooting the ceiling. The bullet hole is still there.</p>
                                    <img src={Day9Pic19} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                                    <p>When we got in we definitely got a sense of the fanciness that would have so offended Pancho Villa's Marxist sensibilities. It had this amazing old world charm about it, the kind of place where you'd imagine great people meeting each other. We asked to be seated near the bullet hole and sure enough, there it was, a small hole in the ceiling around a table over.</p>
                                    <img src={Day9Pic13} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                                    <p>But it wasn't just one Mexican outlaw we were focused on. We - Steph firstly, but me also once she pointed it out - quickly came to the belief that the guys at the table next to us were Cartel.</p>
                                    <p>They were a group of five guys, one older Godfather types and four younger up-and-comers, all wearing expensive suits and ordering countless bottles of brandy, tequila and lord alone knows what else. They had the Mariachi band on retainer for at least two hours, which was great for us being on the next table.</p>
                                    <p>The guys didn't really have a sense of menace about them like you'd expect. It's not like they were acting like the Salamanca Brothers, not that I'd expect real cartel members to act like that. They were fairly genial and I shared a nod with one in mutual appreciation for the music.</p>
                                    <p>I did get a vague, blurry photo of them which I disguised as taking a photo of the Mariachi band. We had a few delicious cocktails there before heading out, wanting to see what else the city had to offer on our last night.</p>
                                    <img src={Day9Pic14} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                                    <p>We headed back to our rooftop bar, wanting to see the city at night and knowing that it wasn't going to be too busy. We got a beer and looked out at the busy downtown at night. We knew we'd miss the city both in Cancun and back in the UK. It's definitely one of the coolest cities we've been to, and anyone who's been to Cancun or elsewhere in Mexico without seeing it has done themselves a disservice.</p>
                                    <img src={Day9Pic16} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                                    <p>We stayed for a beer, looking out onto the shining city at night. We were going to a place that Carlos had recommended to us on our very first day in CDMX, a little place called Tortas Al Fuego. After one more drink back at the cantina we got a cab over. The place was a lot more down-at-home than the cantina, looking like a school lunch hall, but had an amazing character to it. It was a very popular spot, but with locals rather than tourists - which means Carlos had steered us entirely right. We had delicious pastor tacos and enjoyed our status as the only non-Mexicans there. It wasn't too much of a walk back so despite the late hour we walked, drinking in the city while we could.</p>

                                        <p>Our flight was at 1pm today, which would normally mean we'd try to sqeeze in one more activity, but we had a load of packing and prepping to do. We got packed up and got an Uber, arriving at about half ten and going straight to the lounge for some breakfast.</p>
                                        <p>There was bad turbulence on the flight which wasn't great, but we landed without too much of a delay and headed out, only to be immediately assailed by the same cab stand hucksters shouting for people. Steph handled it while I watched the bags but the cab company didn't come from a while. We'd have got an Uber, but we'd heard the news that they'd been essentially banned from the airport due to pressure from the local cabbies, which had explained why we hadn't seen them come up in our spot when we first arrived.</p>
                                        <p>We'd had a bit of confusion but we were sure we were going to the right place. We were going to the Hotel Tequila in Cancun, the problem was that there was a much bigger resort down in Playa Del Carmen where most people went. So Steph had had to be very precise when describing the place, but our cabbie knew the score.</p>
                                        <p>We got into the Hotel Tequila late afternoon. It was in the middle of the jungle and wasn't anything like the resort. It reminded me of a backpacker's place we went to in Mirissa, Sri Lanka, but was nice and the room was basic but nice. We got ready - Steph was dressed to the nines and I was wearing my guyabara. We headed out to downtown Cancun and got a Fat Tuesdays. We haven't had a Fat Tuesdays since Vegas, and it's just a massive sign of a holiday in our eyes. We realised after buying that we were nowhere near Cocobongo, so a quick followup Uber ride got us to where we wanted.</p>
                                        <p>We were going back to the main nightlife street in Cancun. We'd seen a bit of it back the night before the resort when we'd gone to that seafood bar with the Micheladas. That had felt a long time ago. We saw the place in more detail now and it was an assault on the senses. I felt like I was in Ibiza or Ayia Napa but with that sort of American (for American it truly was) excess . Holding central court was Cocobongo, a place that made every other spot on the strip seem like a library in comparison. </p>
                                        <p>Cocobongo has a unique place in the tapestry that is Cancun. It's a club. It's a live show. It's a hundred film and music references stacked into one. It's a must-see for Spring Breakers, ravers, and regular tourists like us.  </p>
                                        <p>We'd splurged extra on the gold membership, which got us into the entry bar with complimentary drinks as well as seating on the mezzanine. We'd had time for a couple of cocktails before we got called in.</p>
                                        <p>Cocobongo is set in a large single room that's got a dance floor in the middle and some elevated seating on either side. At the head is a large stage designed for huge set pieces. We got into our mezzanine seats and were one away from the front. Which in the money-talks atmosphere of Cocobongo means that we were going to be shamelessly upsold for a frontrow seat. The waitress tried it every which way but with the large fee - the amount of which I can't remember - we weren't tempted.</p>
                                        <p>The service definitely dipped after that, but we still tipped reasonably good. The whole thing is a cash grab. They were trying to sell everything from photos to merch as hard as they could. There was one guy with a bandanna who was without any semblance of shame and as he pushed his way past again and again I got the strong urge to hit him. But my cooler head prevailed.</p>
                                        <p>Soon the shows begum and they were incredible. There was the Mask, various dances, and even major set pieces like a load of hench dudes in Spartan armour recreating 300. The Mask was a consistent theme and I realised why on the plane home on rewatching the movie - Cocobongo is the name of the club in the film. It's interesting how naming conventions of things like clubs change. In the 70s and the 80s the standard naming format was The X Club, like The Cocobongo Club or the Babylon Club from Scarface. Somewhere in the 90s or Noughties the convention changed to a single name - Cocobongo, or Babylon.</p>

                                        <p>Steph soon made friends with a group of American girls who were out for a good time, and they went up to dance on the little balcony above the stage. It's a major part of the night - women dressed to the nines queue up to dance to whatever song is playing, and Steph was one of those!</p>
                                        <img src={Day10Pic1} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                                        <p>We partied til at least three in the morning. Everywhere that could have food was either closed or looked dodgy, and our beds were calling. We got an Uber back and found to our dismay that the main gate was closed - we were locked out.</p>
                                        <p>The first thing I did was to try and scale the gate - bad move. The wood is jagged and has no purchase whatsoever, and I quickly gave up. What I had to do was essentially barge and force the door until we could slip inside. It was a much better option than sleeping by the roadside so we showered and got into bed. We'd be feeling rough tomorrow - least of all because we were going home!</p>

                                        <p>I woke up quite a bit before Steph, as I often do - especially when we've had a drink. I was rough. This was a bad hangover, not a holiday push-through hangover. Steph woke up not long after and we started to think about how to spend our last day. We were flying late afternoon so didn't have timme for a full day's activity, but we could wrap up a few last bits.</p>
                                        <p>There's an outlet shopping center nearby and we got an Uber there. We were starving after not eating and ended up getting about three or four different dishes from the food court.</p>
                                        <p>After that, we wrapped up a few loose ends shopping-wise. We got some extra souvenirs for people and for our Mexican cooking journey on our return to the UK such as Mexican cornflower, hot sauce and other ingredients. The sunshine outside, and the walk around, was helping with the unending hangover and by the time we got back we were in fairly decent stead.</p>
                                        <p>We got back well in time to make it to the airport. The hotel was able to offer us a lift for free apart from the tip to the guy. He got us there, us feeling down for reasons that had little to do with the still-remaining hangovers. We went to a Guy Fieri's for some final Micheladas and food, then boarded.</p>
                                        <img src={Day11Pic1} alt="day1" className="landscapePicture" />
                                        <p>Mexico was a game-changer, and a life-changer of a holiday. It was a major shakeup in terms of food, and Steph has diligently made Mexican deliciousness a reality since we've got back. But also, this reflects a gateway - both to more of Mexico, like Oaxaca, and the rest of Central America. Watch this space.</p>
                                        <p>The flight was fairly spotless and we arrived early the next morning, exhausted from the night flight and missing Mexico but eager to continue the odyssey.</p>
