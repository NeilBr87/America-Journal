                        <p>If there was one thing Steph and I both knew going into 2024, it was that we needed a major holiday. We'd had a great time in Morocco back in '23, one small earthquake aside, but we had two crucial ingredients that we'd lacked before; a joint income and enough of a stable routine to plan out leave.</p>
                        <p>Of course, thanks to my company's less than stellar leave allowance, this was never going to be a massive three week holiday like America 2022. It would be a two weeker, but it was going to be massive in terms  of the adventure. Nowhere in Europe or nearby like North Africa. It would have to be transcontinental, and our selections were quickly narrowed down.</p>
                        <p>America, this time the Deep South, was a possibility - but leaving only two years between American trips naturally may have made things less special. India was another possibility, particularly some of the northern cities: Jaipur, Agra, Delhi. At the same time, Japan had been very much on the list for both of us for some time. I'd had my reservations when I was younger, but with the benefit of age those all seemed quite silly, and it was clear that Japan would be a holiday of a lifetime.</p>                    
                        <p>Our initial plan had been to fly to Seoul - much cheaper than Tokyo - then get a ferry across after a few days exploring South Korea. But once we looked at it for more than a few moments, it was clear that while there are ferry routes between Seoul and Japan, it only takes you to the very southern tip of Japan, which wasn't great logistically. That's not the only reason; in even a brief look at a Japanese travel itinerary, it was clear that there would be enough in Japan - even Tokyo - to cover even an extended holiday, so it would make much more sense to devote the holiday to Japan and go to South Korea another time.</p>
                        <p>After a brief browse of multi-city journeys we decided that a simple return flight from Tokyo was the easiest way to go. Japan's such an amazing place as far as public transport is concerned, including the legendary <i>Shinkansen</i> - the bullet train. This would allow us quick passage to Kyoto, the cultural capital and one of the must-sees in any trip of Japan. We had one more key destination in mind too, the northern island of Hokkaido, a vast open space with some of the best scenery in the world. It turned out that wasn't so easy on the Bullet Train, so we booked an internal flight from Osaka nearby Kyoto.</p>
                        <p>And so it was that after months of planning that we ended up at Gatwick on an unseasonably chilly morning. We'd stayed the night at 8 Shirley Road the night before and had aimed for as little sleep as possible to get some sleep on the plane. Terence had driven us to East Croydon, which I hate to go through when coming back from a holiday but love coming out from because it reminds me of everything we leave behind when we go away.</p>
                        <p>We got to Gatwick early, and not just because this was an important flight. Steph had recently signed up to an AMEX Gold card, meaning access to all sorts of cool VIP airport lounges. We made a beeline for the lounge as soon as we dropped off the hold luggage, and were soon greeted with an option that was definitely more luxurious than waiting in a departure lounge, but would be a teensy bit overshadowed by the VIP lounges we enountered later. There was breakfast food - the classic staples you get everywhere in England - bacon, sausages, eggs, and a few generic croissaints and pastries. There was also the drink. The airport seems to be the only place where you can rock up at 8am and be clamouring for a pint. We had a few drinks at the (predictably way too regulated) bar then head to our gate.</p>
                        <p>It was a long flight - eleven hours - but it didn't feel insane. Steph slept for a fair bit of it, and I slept for at least half an hour. We were flying with China Eastern and their film selection was abysmal compared to pretty much anyone else we'd been with and after trying to watch Aquaman and The Flash I settled on Sorry We Missed You, a grim northern portrayal of zero hour contracts in Newcastle.</p>
                        <p>We were stopping off in Shanghai for three hours, which we'd reasoned would be long enough, and it would have been - if it wasn't for a gate change that completely blindsided us. We arrived in a section that seemed completely empty and as Steph was freshening up a guy came shouting about a flight to Haneda. I called out after him, but it looked like it was an earlier than our flight. That's what I thought - turns out it was more of a communication error.</p>
                        <p>Cut to about twenty minutes later and we realised that we were not only in the wrong departure lounge, the right one was on the whole opposite side of the airport. We asked the same guy who'd been shouting for Haneda Airport before and he told us - through extensive use of a translation app - that the gate had already closed. Keeping the panic attacks at bay, we went back to the security gate and went through everything again while the staff expressed their exasperation with us. We got onto a later flight for free, which was great, and everything seemed to have worked out - except one tragic detail. We'd been booked into the 5.30 slot of the Dawn Avatar Robot Cafe, an awesome cafe and restaruant where you get served by robots! We were looking forward to it as an introduction to the fantastic weirdness of Tokyo, but we were now automatically too late.</p>
                        <p>We did have one consolation prize, however. The VIP lounge in Shanghai made the Gatwick lounge look like a Wetherspoons. It looked like the kind of place where you'd do a GQ photoshoot. The place had a sleek, professional look, with great food - bao buns, Chinese delicacies - and drinks - plentiful beers, wines and spirits - being generously replenished. As we sat there enjoying this luxury we reflected that this wasn't the bad start we thought it was.</p>
                        <p>We boarded the next flight and before long we were landing at Haneda Airport. We were full of excitement as we went through the airport, got our hold luggage that had been delayed for us, and headed towards the underground, where we'd be heading to Shibuya.</p>
                        <p>Shibuya is a great entry point into Tokyo. Firstly, you've got everything that you'll see later on - constant neon, a busy train station, lots of bars and restaurants. But Shibuya doesn't get the same intense number of tourists as the other Tokyo cities, so it can be walked and navigated without being too overwhelmed.</p>
                        <img src={Day1Pic1} alt="Day 2 Pic 2" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>After an (unsurprisingly quiet!) train ride that carried us through quiet Japanese towns and open countryside all the way into the the big city! From there, it was a shorter journey to Shibuya Station, one of the major stations in Tokyo and quite probably the world. Stepping off of the platform into the main station will stay with both of us for a very long time. It's an insane, unfathomably busy, place with a million different people and types of people. Navigating it is no easy feat. We took around half an hour to find the right exit, finally getting out and towards the hotel. Going to street level was like walking into Blade Runner. The street was swathed in bright neon lights from the tops of the tall skyscrapers to the shops that lined the road. It was like stepping into a different world, one we'd seen in pictures and films before but looked even more out there in real life.</p>
                        <img src={Day1Pic2} alt="Day 2 Pic 2" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>Despite the otherworldness, we noticed something as we walked. Shibuya, in a way that's quite unique to Tokyo but that it has in common with Sapporo, looks like an American city - specifically Las Vegas. It has insanely wide roads and is lined with overpasses that see plenty of traffic. We crossed one of these to get to our hotel, and from the top, we got a startling view. The two of us had a palpable "Damn, we're finally here!" moment that wasn't even slighly diminished by our long journey. </p>
                        <img src={Day1Pic3} alt="Day 2 Pic 2" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>We found the hotel after a quick look arouund, and it was a nice, clean place - although the room, and especially the bathroom, was a bit small. We were tired after the long journey but also hungry, so we headed back to near the station in search of some food. We found a delicious sushi place and started our Japanese culinary experience with some sushi. Then we headed back and showered, ready to sleep off our travels. </p>

                    <div className="days" id="day2"> 
                        <p>We awoke to pouring rain the next morning, itching to start exploring. We'd both slept well without much in the way of jetlag, which was a result considering that we'd gone about as far east as it was possible to go in this odd marble. Today we were going southeast, to Tokyo Harbour and Ginza City. We were going to start our day at the world-famous Toyuso Fish Market right in the heart of the harbour. We grabbed some breakfast at the hotel - it was mostly pastries, but they had fairly okay coffee and - result for me - what I now assume to be authentic Hokkaido milk based on the taste. We headed out and got drenched within a few minutes in the heavy rain. We headed to a nearby 7-11 and bought rain ponchos, a move I'd have normally objected to on a fashion basis, but the rain was intense.</p>
                        <p>Cut to horror a few minutes later when we realised we were the only two people in the whole of Shibuya wearing the things, and that they definitely made us look like <i>baka gaijin</i>. We huddled in them until the station, dripping wet all over the Ginza line all the way to the harbour. We had a short walk to Toyuso proper.</p>
                        <img src={Day2Pic1} alt="Day 2 Pic 2" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>Toyuso is so distinctly Tokyo that I'm surprised it isn't featured on more of the tourist ads. It's a couple of solid square miles of tightly-packed streets and tented market stall, with tourists and locals clamouring for the delicious food. There was every kind of seafood a person could imagine, including favourites that the top fishmonger at Billingsgate wouldn't have been able to identify. Most it it was being sold for instant eating purposes; there was a trades fish market there but it was clearly overshadowed by the masses of food stalls. We went along, helping ourselves to everything, but the star of the show was a delicious king crab leg that could only be described as 'roughly human-sized'. The flavour was absolutely indescribable, buttery (without any actual butter) and glorious. We had a few more bites after that, ranging in beautiful strangeness from wagyu on a stick to matcha soda ice cream float.</p>
                        <img src={Day2Pic2} alt="Day 2 Pic 2" className="portraitPictures" />
                        <p>Once we'd eaten our fill, it was time to head out to our first proper booked activity - TeamLabs Planets in nearby Ginza. It was one of things I got most excited about when booking up Japan, and I think I spread my enthusiasm to Steph. It's a cutting-edge, ultra-cool modern art exhibition run by an artistic collective. And if you're thinking that sounds boring, you'd be right - if this was a standard modern art exhibition and not one of the coolest man-made things you'll ever see in your lifetime. It's an extreme show of colour, light, and spectacle that you really won't see anywhere else in the world.</p>
                        <img src={Day2Pic3} alt="Day 2 Pic 3" className="portraitPictures" />
                        <p>We arrived and were filed into a locker room where we took our shoes and socks off. That's not just a Japanese thing - as soon as we got through our feet got submerged in water that flowed as we walked through to the exhibits. The first large room we entered - and it looked incomparably large, though with the extensive mirrors it was probably not too much bigger than a tennis court. This was the LED forest - a room with a thousand LED tendrils descending from the ceiling, sending out bright light patterns that are incredible to look at. We found a space to sit - more like lay down to take everything in - and stared at the incredible display. It was dazzling experience and we were already giddy when it came to the next room. As soon as we walked in, we were confronted with gigantic balls. That's not the start of a traumatic experience, that is literally what it means - huge, person sized bouncing balls that change colour every few seconds and can be explored in about every way a person could think of - bounced on, jumped against, and climbed. It wasn't as visually stunning as the LED forest but it was a phenomenal experience.</p>
                        <img src={Day2Pic5} alt="Day 2 Pic 5" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>We got back into water before the next room, and unlike before it got deeper instead of more shallow. We came out into a place that took our breath away - a vibrant pond made with nothing but light. LED reeds and vegetation swayed in an imaginary wind and holographic rainbow trout in every conceivable colour 'swam' around us with calm abandon. The whole thing was such an immense headrush and it only intensified when we realised that the reeds and the fish adapted to movement in a way nothing else thus far had. The reeds stuck to me wherever I moved, and the fish wriggled away when you put a hand or a foot near them. It was utterly amazing, only marred by the fact that I got a jolt of fear every time I took my phone out. If I dropped it mid-snap or put it back in my pocket in a way that it could easily fall out, it would plunge into the murky depths, instantly becoming both brickified by the water and lost forever in the murky depths.</p>
                        <img src={Day2Pic4} alt="Day 2 Pic 4" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>We headed out after a little while and went through a few smaller rooms, most of which were physical experiences rather than light shows - floor that felt like quicksand, walls you could bounce off, that sort of thing. We started to wonder how TeamLabs would top the trout pond when we walked into a room that melted our brains.</p>
                        <p>It was another large dark room, this time with no mirrors. At first, the central feature of the room just looked like a lightshow - then we looked up and saw one of the coolest things either of us had ever seen. It was an artificial sky of colours, vibrant flowers and foliage, and fascinating patterns. It was moving across from one side of the room to the other, and while the logical side of my brain knew that the lightshow was moving and not the room, you instantly got absorbed in this notion that you were on a spinning plane, hurtling through a universe that smiled down at us benevolently. We lay there for what was probably only about fifteen minutes but could have just as easily been hours.</p>
                        <img src={Day2Pic6} alt="Day 2 Pic 6" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>The next section was the garden, the only outdoor area. The rain had stopped so we went out without our hideous ponchos or an umbrella - which, this being Japan, was free - into a lush open air area that was covered in these strange, almost Easter Island-looking statues, but in miniature and without faces, and translucent plastic. They all played a different sound when you moved them, which was really cool - but everything naturally paled in comparison to what we'd seen inside. The next area came slighlty closer, though; it was a garden that was completely full of vibrant, beautiful flowers that descended from a trellis. We had to slide on our backs to go through the room without touching them, which was a weird experience but was very worth it as we stared up at the beautiful bouquets.</p>
                        <img src={Day2Header} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>That was the last little bit of the tour, and we headed out, awed by all the amazing things we'd seen. The rain had started up again but only as a light trickle, which was fine because we only had a short walk before the bus to our next destination, Akihabara Electric Town. Akihabara is one of the most distinctive areas of Tokyo, and even Japan. It's the very epicenter of everything related to anime, manga, video and card games, and geek culture. It's also the place to find all sorts of bizarre and cutting edge electronics that you'd never find in the UK. We got a bus then subway over to the area and headed out. As soon as we did, we took in the wonders of the place. Like what we'd seen of Tokyo so far, every building was swathed in displays and posters bombarding passers-by, but unlike Shibuya or Shinjuku, it's very specified towards the core geek products. We looked around and saw massive department stores full of smaller stores probably selling everything you could imagine, huge comic emporiums, and to my delight, amusement arcades.</p>
                        <p>First, though, we had to eat. We were both starving after our breakfast of delicious crab all those hours ago. We stopped in at a place not far from the subway station that looked cool and authentic and sat in a small, stuffy but nice place with grills on the table. We picked out a beef dish and cooked it gently on the grill, wolfing it down hungrily. Most of the people there looked like otaku - basically an ultrageek - but it was a cool, quirkly little place and we enjoyed our meat dish.</p>
                        <img src={Day2Pic8} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>We went into a department store first, a place that was multiple stories tall. There was a toy shop that had these amazingly detailed figures based on anime and games, and I seem to recall recognising a few figures from Final Fantasy VII - pretty much my only foray into Japanese gaming. Upstairs there was a trading card place that was small was but absolutely jampacked with different trading card games, from Pokemon to Yu-Gi-Oh, the former of which Steph and I had talked about quite a bit in the leadup to the trip, and the latter Steph had barely heard of but gave me such an immense rush of nostalgia; I hadn't thought of it in years, but I really enjoyed the show, and I got flashbacks of printing off online copies of the cards with Patrick and cutting them out so we could duel. We looked around and went further up, seeing a whole library's worth of manga.</p>
                        <p>There were more floors, but they were less cutesy and innocent. All of the floors above this one were more adult, and while I won't go into detail, almost all of it was devoted to schoolgirls. It's one part of Japanese culture that I don't particularly like, and while there's a lot worse in the world, it made me feel a bit queazy whenever I saw a group of happy, cheerful schoolgirls afterwards knowing that there were grown men somewhere that were way too interested in them.</p>
                        <p>After we left the department store, we went to go find more places to shop - and saw something that at least Steph had been interested in trying out - a Maid Cafe. Maid Cafes are part of that same unsavoury cultural element that produced some of the stuff we'd seen on the top floors of that department store. They're not as bad as Host and Hostess Cafes - a grimly exploitative enterprise designed to drain obscene amounts of cash by basically convincing lonely people they're in a relationship. They're fairly straightforward cafes except that your servers are all 18 (and probably younger) year old girls. One of the things Akihabara is famous for is its cosplay maid cafes, where the girls dress up like anime characters.</p>
                        <p>We had no idea what the girl outside was dressed as, but I agreed with some hesitation - its's not a good look. James May refused to go into one outright when he was in Japan, but Steph was still keen. We agreed we'd look around for the best one once our appetites picked back up after our barbecue lunch, especially once we saw the photos of the menu and our stomachs turned. The food was meant to be 'kawaii' - a Japanese word that could be basically summed up as 'ineffably cute' - but it was disgusting beyond all measure. First there was a 'burger bear' a grotesque cartoony bear face made out of ground beef with disgusting, overcooked-looking vegetables. The next was a lasagne that looked like it wouldn't have passed quality control for Tesco ready meals with some kanji lettering squired onto it in ketchup. I'm a visual eater and it particularly turned my stomach.</p>
                        <p>As we walked, we saw more anime girls handing out flyers, and as Steph hates any form of social interaction I was the one to grab flyers, something that made me look like a real creep. We didn't come across one that we liked, though we did at least go into one of the Maid Cafes later in the holiday - and we didn't like it one bit. Instead, we went to an electronic supermarket, the kind of place where you can buy anything. the problem was that as very little of it was in English, this was restricted to things that we actually visually understood, like keyboards. They had an amazing array of computer keyboards, all of which looked amazing and stylish, but the price - they averaged around £70 - and the fact that the keys were in Japanese put me off. After we'd had our fill shopping electronics, it was time to hit the arcades.</p>
                        <p>Akihabara is the global hub of arcades, and that was music to our ears. I'm a seasoned arcade game lover who first felt the bug playing House of the Dead near Bognor Regis pier when I was probably not too much older than Leo is, and while Steph's a bit of a neophyte when it comes to arcades, she was keen to try them out.</p>
                        <img src={Day6Header} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>The first place we went to was by Bandai, creators of Bandai Namcoworld in the Trocadero in London. It had about six floors of arcade games, all of them brilliant. Our first spot was the Dance Dance Revolution machine, which for reasons I'll never understand (space?) are never a mainstay of seaside arcades. Consequently I haven't played one since my teens, and I was itching to show Steph the ropes. Despite being terribly uncoordinated at it when I'd tried it out when I was younger, I was actually really good at it. Steph was too, but I scraped a win. We went through all six floors, trying out classics either neither of us had heard of or which I'd long forgotten. But it was getting late, and we were getting hungry. We headed out, and my prevailing memory of the place was an old grandmother beaming with delight and recording her grandson playing some game I can't remember. It was a nice little reminder that Akihabara aws just as much for family fun as it was the seedy stuff we'd seen earlier.</p>
                        <img src={Day2Pic9} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="portraitPictures" />
                        <p>We were headed over to Chuo-dori, Ginza's most famous restaurant street. We walked around, checking out the restaurants at both ends of the street. The rain had intensified, but it wasn't the worst thing in the world; a rainy night in Tokyo may be an unpleasant sweaty mess but the rain and the neon gives the city an amazing noirish feel. We decided to stop at a place that looked popular and it had a ticket system, so we had to shelter from the rain for about ten minutes. We had a few different dishes - sashimi, crab salad, and a few more uttery delicious dishes that we enjoyed. We sat at the counter and had a lot of communication with our chef, which allowed me to try out some of the Japanese phrases I'd learned when it comes to food. At the start of the meal you say 'itadakimasu', pronounced 'itadakimass' - which means 'thank you for the feast'. If the meal was excellent, and this one was, you say 'gochiso samedishida' which means 'it was a feast!' The chef seemed delighted that we knew it, and even more delighted when I asked in probably butchered but honest Japanese if we could take photographs.</p>
                        <img src={Day2Pic7} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>We didn't want the night to be over just then, and we'd seen a karaoke place down the road. Turns out, we didn't quite understand Tokyo's concept of multistorey entertainment and headed straight in the direction of the first bar we saw, being ushered in by two cheerful promoter types. It wasn't until we ordered a drink that I actually asked about karaoke, and the answer was no, so we left the cost of two beers and one small cover charge lighter. There was a karaoke place, but we weren't sure how to get to it, and there was another karaoke place down the road - Big Echo.</p>
                        <img src={Day2Pic10} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>It wasn't the raucous karaoke bar experience we'd been expecting, but was instead a karaoke booth that you rented by the hour. The main area looked like a classy yet empty late night bar and the booths were nice and comfy. We paid for an hour and dove in, singing some of our favourite karaoke tunes from Vampire Weekend, OutKast, and Rush (me) and Beyonce, Rihanna and Credence Clearwater (Steph, that complex lass). We had a whale of a time, but the hour went way too quick. We headed back to the hotel, still enjoying the look of Tokyo in the rain, showered and slept.</p>

                        <p>We woke up the next morning to glorious sunshine, replacing the grim weather of yesterday. Unfortunately, that wasn't the only thing I woke up to; I had a sore, scratchy throat. At first I thought it was just the aircon (I always get a sore throat with strong air conditioning) but it proved to be something different entirely - but more on that later.</p>
                        <p>This morning we were headed over to Senso-Ji, probably the most famous Shinto shrine in Japan (or anywhere really because it doesn't really exist outside of Japan and her diaspora) and one of Tokyo's must-sees. We took a quick trip on the subway and got there without much hassle. Steph, normally my equal when it came to navigation, had really taken the lead here. Only her phone was able to use an eSim, so she was able to get directions up, but she took charge when it came to getting us around, me only occasionally providing observational support when she was too short to see a particular sign.</p>
                        <img src={Day3Pic1} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>The area around Senso-Ji is of the Edo period and is very well-preserved; not as well-preserved as Kyoto, but very pretty. The only thing that belied that prettiness was the absolute solid mass of crowd. Nowhere we'd seen so far had this many people and it was quite jarring. I have some slightly agoraphobic moments, and Steph is small so she couldn't hide in the clouds like I can. </p>
                        <img src={Day3Pic2} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>We headed towards the template and saw the Hōzōmon Gate, an ornate entryway into the temple's central concourse. Once we were through we were on a wide tiled pathway with the main temple, impressive and vast, straight ahead of us. You got this immense sense of how ancient the thing was and how many people must have been inspired by its beauty and its majesty. They may have had a bit more solitude to ponder it than we had in the present, but it was still an incredible site. The temple didn't have an accessible interior but it was incredible to look at all the same, and we wandered the grounds and the surrounding gardens with a sense of peace and fulfillment that wasn't affected even slightly by the masses of people, the heat, or my quickly-developing sore throat.</p>
                        <img src={Day3Pic3} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>Once we'd had our fill of serene and beautiful green spaces we had to get on the move for another grand Japanese cultural tradition - Sumo! We had a Sumo wrestling event booked at midday over on the other side of Asakusa, and we were excited. It was a whole event with a hotpot meal and unlimited fried chicken, as well as a geisha before the actual fight. There were lots of added extras too, like several photo ops (complimentary photo included) and an opportunity to wrestle one of the fighters. We got there in good time and took our seats. It was a surprisingly large arena with about four tiers of seats and an actual fighting ring probably only a bit smaller than a boxing ring. We took our seats and got tucked into a beer, fried chicken, and our hotpot, as well as a pancake dish that you also see in sushi. Japanese fried chicken is just different to the rest of the world, I can't really explain it. The batter is a lot thinner than what you find elsewhere to the extent that it's more like a glaze than a full deep fry. The taste is immense. You pick up these amazing hints of lemon and subtle spices that you'd never find in an English supermarket.</p>
                        <p>The hotpot was amazing too, a hearty broth with strong, meaty flavours that soothed my throat slightly and was extremely moreish. Before long, the announcer came out and introduced the show. He was an American of around fifty years old and he'd been living in Japan for quite a few years. When communicating with the geisha, the wrestlers and the local audience members his Japanese seemed very strong, and you could see he had a passion for the place. If I had to define his entertainment style I would call it less-sleazy Seinfeld meets less-sleazy Brett Gelman (not that either of those men are particularly sleazy, well, not that Gelman isn't) but he had a very similar easy comedic style. The first act that he announced was the geisha, and she came out - kimono, facepaint, the works - and did a traditional dance. It was really cool to see. Many people misunderstand geishas and think it's some sort of escort service - it isn't. These women are meant to be the guardians of culture and refinement in an age where it's no longer the norm. Of course, outsiders - and even customers - don't always see it that way but that's their fault.</p>
                        <p>The dance was very engaging and the geisha was obviously very practiced. She used her fan; fan positioning is everything to a geisha and the angle is meant to be a form of communication all of its own. Once the dance was over, the geisha took photos with the crowd then headed out and the two fighters came out. It was amazing; these guys were right out of what the brain jumped to when it said the word 'Sumo'. One of the guys looked at least 20 stone, and while he was a big guy, a big chunk of it was muscle. The other guy was slightly slimmer and taller but still a huge guy in both senses of the word. They started off with a few light spars, throwing huge chunks of salt into the ring to purify it. There was so much of the stuff that I honestly believe that if I were to eat the sand, it would taste delicious. We got given fun guides on how to cheer the guys on then they came out for the proper match.</p>
                        <img src={Day3Pic4} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>It was an impressive display. These guys were retired Sumo wrestlers, but they still had a lot of skill, and while there was alot of showboating and showmanship, you could tell that they were still skilled pros. It wasn't exactly UFC, but even though it had less technicality it was still more ancient and ultimately more interesting.</p>
                        <img src={Day3Pic5} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>The smaller guy won after a short but engaging conflict, and we cheered him on enthusiastically even though he represented the other side of the room. Once the match was done, it was time for members of the audience to challenge their choice of wrestler. I'd originally thought about doing this myself, but I didn't feel it as much for now. I was feeling slightly off; my throat was really bad, and I felt a bit tired and bothered. For another, I was worried that I would struggle to get my defence up and he'd floor me in a couple of seconds. I also had a fear that I consider pretty bizarre in hindsight; it was that I'd try to use my legs to take him out, Judo-style, and accidentally slice his calf with my jagged toenails or something. A few people came up, including, adorably, a girl who couldn't have been older than five. The only person who came up that I thought might have had a shot was an Australian guy who had come here with his partner and a couple of friends. He had a lot of raw power behind his physique; the kind of physique that generally represents hardcore strength, more so than the pro wrestler body type.</p>
                        <p>The competitors came out wearing novelty Sumo costumes and took on their choice of wrestler. The guys toyed with them to the delight of the crowd, making thme think that they were winning before they took them out. The little girl was the cutest fight. Then the Aussie guy came out and his chosen wrestler, I think it was the biggest guy, kinda scaled back the theatrics, recognising him as someone that could actually pose a threat. As it turned out, the Aussie guy won - it was a hard fight, but he got the better of the seasoned pro. It was a fun time all in all, and we were able to stick around for a while and take photos with the guys and the geisha. THey were quite friendly and easygoing, and seemed to love what they did even though they weren't part of the tournament scene anymore. On our way out we got talking to the American host, who turned out to be an amazing font of knowledge about Tokyo. He told us about Harajuku, one of the coolest counterculture and fashion districts of Tokyo, and we were keen to go.</p>
                        <p>We were next headed to the Tokyo National Museum, but first, our American friend told us about a major shopping area nearby. We went there and found a large department store with about five different floors of groceries. Steph was delighted to see that they had Japanese peaches, the most mouthwatering variant, as well as Muscat grapes. We bought these and a few more snacks for us as well as some beginner souvenirs, putting them in the bag and taking the subway over to the museum.</p>
                        <img src={Day3Pic6} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>The museum is in a grand complex in the middle of a quiet, leafy corner of Taito City. It had the clasic Japanese architecutural design, looking very similar to Senso-Ji except in its muted colours. We dropped our bags off and headed in the two directions I was most itching to visit: armour and katanas. It feels terribly reductionist to boil the most interesting parts of Japanese history to these two objects but they are so very cool. Most of the katanas were presented for the pure quality of the blade over the design of the hilt; it was only the blade that was on show. On the one hand it's the accompanyments - the distinctive hilt, the ornamental scabbard - that at least partially make the katana as cool as it is, but these were some of the best blades in the world, and even a layman like me could see the craftsmanship in the rolled steel. The armour, though, was a different matter entirely. It was an all-mod-cons affair, and you saw the entire set, including mask and all the small details that we recognised from watching Shogun. It was all amazing, but there was one problem - we were already exhausted. The sun had beaten down on us all day, and more to the point we were taking turns at carrying a bag that was now very heavy. Furthermore, I was definitely getting some weird achy feelings along with my throat.</p>
                        <img src={Day3Pic7} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="portraitPictures" />
                        <p>We checked out a couple more sections then headed outside, cooling down with a drink from a vending machine. Tonight we would be heading to Shibuya Scramble Crossing, one of the most famous intersections in the world if famous intersections are actually really a thing. We decided to drop the heavy bag off at the room first since the crossing was only ten minutes walk from us, and it immediately felt like the pressure was off. We headed off in that direction, finding it much easier to walk.</p>
                        <img src={Day3Pic8} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="portraitPictures" />
                        <p>There are a few words I can associate with Shibuya Scramble Crossing: Hectic; amazing; chaotic. But none of them describe it as well as the word <i>sonder</i>. This word, created by a linguist called John Koenig, can be defined as "the feeling one has on realizing that every other individual one sees has a life as full and real as one’s own, in which they are the central character and others, including oneself, have secondary or insignificant roles". I first heard this word a few years back and loved it, but I'd never seen as good of an example of it until we got to Shibuya Scramble Crossing. Thousands of people making the same track. Everyone of them with a complex net of friends and family, none of whom either of us would ever meet and each of them having their own complex net of friends and family that most probably no one waiting at the same crossing will ever meet or even pass by, despite the fact that they live in the same city. It's fairly mind blowing. Every few minutes, no more than five between, people do this same crossing, waiting patiently as cars speed past before taking control of the crossing, streaming across as a single human wave.</p>
                        <img src={Day3Pic9} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>We headed up to a Starbucks that Steph's friend Hong had recommended as a great viewing platform, but the queue was miles long and the best viewing point was only for paying customers. Of course, we snuck in anyway, but we didn't stay long. Instead we decided to head to the upper floors of the large building that the Starbucks was in, and I'm very glad we did. The immediate upper floor was some sort of executive lounge for people wanting to catch up on work - and eat and drink for an hour or more for a flat rate. The rate was generous and we took a seat directly overlooking the crosing.</p>
                        <p> The food and drink was great, very similar to the airport lounge in Shanghai with spirits generously laid out, as well as a fridge full of niche beers, sakes and wine. The food was amazing too, and came in hot and cold vareities. We grabbed a drink first, drinking quickly - but responsibly - to get our money's worth before tucking into the gorgeous food. They had microwaveable food like burgers and buns, as well as lots of other snacks. We ate our fill, watching the people go by. There was something truly magical about it - the only exception was the wannabe influencer types who got obsessed with making content as they crossed. They took their time, being in the middle of the road when everyone else was crossing, and narrowly avoiding being hit by cars. The cars, for their part, were out to kill; I think anyone who regularly drove through Scramble Crossing was so fed up of TikTok idiots that vehicular homicide would be a favourable alternative to being held up.</p>
                        <img src={Day3Header} alt="Day 3 Pic 1" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>We finished our hour but the night was young. We were looking for drinks and karaoke again, but not the booth format of Big Echo; an actual public karaoke bar, where Japanese businessmen caroused their colleagues with drink renditions of Tom Jones. Steph found a place only about a twenty minute walk away.</p>
                        <p>It was a random place, tucked neatly in a complex that looked like a block of flats. The bar itself was tiny, probably only a little bit bigger than our living room - and completey deserted. The barman was the only person there, and that would remain the same throughout the night. I imagined that they would have killed it on a weekend, but even a tiny karaoke bar in Tokyo should see a roaring trade, and we talked - discreetly - about how many nights were as deserted as this, and how they could afford to stay open. We took full advantage of the karaoke mics, singing some of our favourites from last night as well as lots more. With our time unrestricted, we found ourselves much more willing to sing more out there, difficult songs, as well as ones over the five minute mark like <i>Jesus of Suburbia</i>. I felt guilty for subjecting the guy to our noise but Steph rightfully pointed out that we were buying drinks and it didn't really matter anyway as our noise would be nothing compared to a busier night.</p>
                        <img src={Day3Pic10} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>Unfortunately, that guilt wasn't the only thing I started to feel. The sore throat now made every sip of beer hurt, and I was getting all sorts of weird feelings: muscle pain, coldness, and a burning forehead along with it. I prayed that this was just me fighting some sort of nasty bug and that I'd be right as rain tomorrow, but soon Steph noticed something was wrong and I mentioned I wasn't feeling well.</p>
                        <img src={Day3Pic11} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>We headed home - it was around 1am and the streets were still bustling. I was shivering even though it wasn't that cold. I collapsed into bed, hoping that a good sleep would sort me out.</p>

                    <div className="days" id="day4">
                        <p>A good sleep didn't sort me out.</p>
                        <p>I woke up feeling pain in every muscle in my body. My nose and throat were completey blocked up and I felt utterly, completely dreadful. Steph - who'd quite reasonably thought that my illness may have been in my head, given how I am about things - immediately saw how bad things were. My face had badly puffed up and every word from out of my mouth sounded like a death rattle. I relayed the sad news - there was absolutey no way I could leave the bed. I stood up even and got intense vertigo before I'd even taken a step. Steph tried to gently coax me out but knew it was a lost cause, but I insisted that she shouldn't lose a day of holiday because of me. We had a reservation at Tokyo Skytree, an observation deck with amazing views of Tokyo, at seven that evening and I vowed that after a day of sleeping I'd be ready to do that, albeit wearing a mask throughout in the likely event that I was contageous.</p>
                        <p>So I settled back down and Steph headed out. First, she headed to the nearby pharmacy and bought some meds for me, being helped out by a nice lady on the checkout despite the obvious language barrier. Following that, she headed into a coffee shop and grabbed a matcha latte for me and an orange juice for herself - she was slightly hungover, as was I in addition to the illness. She kindly dropped them back to me before heading out, walking from Shibuya to nearby Harajuku.</p>
                        <p>Harajuku is the fashion capital of Tokyo. It's one of the most stylish areas and it's a central congregating point for young, fashionable teens. Steph got there in twenty minutes and started to look around, window shopping at the boutiques and beauty salons before going into Takeshita Street. Despite the scatalogical name, Takeshita is a must see for incredible thrift store deals. It was bustling and busy, even matching levels of Senso-Ji the day before. She went into a beauty salon and checked out all the beautify essentials, buying a facemask as well as a powder designed to cool you down. She kept walking down the long street, checking out some of the souvenir shops. She brought the majority of our friends and family souvenirs there, a massive check off the list. </p>
                        <p>After exploring Takeshita, she got on the subway over to central Tokyo, where the Imperial Palace was waiting. I'd been keen to visit this but our American friend at the Sumo club had dampened our enthusiasm by pointing out that you can't go inside. She explored the gardens, walking around and taking in their beauty. They had an amazing sense of scale and tranquility to them, but there wasn't much to do there apart from walk around and look at the palace from afar. She went to go check out Tokyo Tower, an Eiffel-like structure that finds its way ont every landscape photo of the city. It was very impressive to look at. You could get very close to the base of the tower, touching the girders and walking around unrestricted. It was very big and grand, stretching far into the sky. There was an observation deck to visit but there wasn't enough time, so she sat on a bench and looked up at it. She drank some ginseng - for energy - drink that she bought in Harajuku and took in the sights.</p>
                        <p>She also bought some delicious strawberries, then headed back to the room via bus. She got back about half four, letting me know in advance so I was showered and dressed. I'd had a fairly grim day, huddled up for warmth in the bed, alternating between fitful sleep and laying down trying to stop the room from spinning. From all the sleeping, I'd slightly rebounded and didn't feel like the picture of death anymore, and while I was still feverish I could at least move about. I had a bunch of masks in the bag as well as my meds. The walk to Shibuya Station was hard - it's a ten minute walk on average, which would be no worries otherwise but was very difficult in my current condition, especially with the stairs. I was feeling very rough, and went back to sleep as soon as we sat down on the subway. That would be a pattern for me over the next week or so; falling asleep as soon as I wasn't actively moving.</p>
                        <img src={Day4Pic1} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="portraitPictures" />
                        <p>Steph nudged me awake as we got to Tokyo Tower, exploring the shopping complex as we had a bit of time to spare. Steph was hungry, and there were plenty of food places - but I had completely and utterly lost my appetite with my virus. She was keen to try takoyaki, which were balls of octopus in batter. I had no appetite, but lowered my mask and tried to taste one - and I'd lost my sense of taste. Steph ate solo while I tried to stay awake, then we headed up to the tower.</p>

                        <p>The view from Skytree is simply incredible. The city stretched out into the furthest distance, and was already lit up with bright, vibrant colours even though the sun had just set. I couldn't imagine many other cities that look better than Tokyo when lit up at night. We could see the bright spots of Shibuya and Shinjuku as well as several landmarks, like the Diamond and Flower Ferris Wheel over by the harbour and what I thought was Tokyo Tower but Steph wasn't sure. Tokyo is often seen as a city of highrises, and it obviously is, but quite a lot of it is smaller buildings - suburban-style houses surprisingly close to the city centre as well as schools and smaller districts. Every bit of me ached and wanted bed, and every shuffling step I took was painful, but the view was utterly amazing.</p>
                        <img src={Day4Pic3} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>We left after about an hour, me falling immediately asleep on the subway back. On the way back, Steph suggested an excursion for tomorrow in case I couldn't manage a day in Tokyo. One of the ones she found was the Hitachi Seaside Park excursion. It included a trip to the Ōarai Isosaki Shrine and the Nakaminato fish market. The selling point was that I could fall asleep on the bus for almost three hours on the way. I felt guilty about being ill and on a bus full of people, but I rationalised it - I might not be contageous, I'd be wearing a mask all throughout the journey, and everyone else in the last few months had saw fit to travel with anything from a minor cold to full-blown COVID.</p>
                        <img src={Day4Pic4} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>Therefore, I reluctantly agreed, hoping that this was a 24 hour bug and I'd feel better in the morning. We showered and went to bed, me falling asleep within seconds.</p>

                    <div className="days" id="day5">
                        <p>I woke up feeling almost as rotten as yesterday. I say almost, because I know that if the excursion had been booked yesterday, even the threat of a hefty nonrefundable reservation wouldn't have got me out of bed. As it happened I was able to drag myself out of my sickbed, kicking and screaming all the way, pleading with poor Steph to find some way to cancel.</p>,
                        <p>Alas, there was none. We'd lose way too much money for no good reason if I couldn't drag my skeleton up. We headed to Tokyo Central Station, finding the right bus after about ten minutes of frantic exploration. We got into a couple of seats and, yes, I fell asleep within about thirty seconds. By the time I woke up we were about two hours into a two and a half hour drive. Not only that, but were far away from Tokyo, into the wide open. One thing I'd been key to see was the real, rural Japan, the side that most tourists will never see. We were on a motorway, but I was still excited. I felt much better after a long morning nap, though I was still far from my best.</p>
                        <p>What was more, Steph was excited. Unlike me, she loved excursions, and didn't mind the time-restricted nature of the day. In just over half an hour - for which I danced in and out of sleep - we arrived at Ōarai for the Ōarai Isosaki Shrine. It was called a city, but it was really a small town with a threadbare - but lovely - main road. We parked outside the entrance to the shrine itself, which unlike the others we'd seen which were squared-away compounds, this one extended from the main shrine site, down some strairs past the main road and all the way to the sea. My legs immediately croaked as I walked, and the pouring rain didn't do much to improve that, but the nap had done me good.</p>
                        <img src={Day5Pic1} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>We crossed the road, following a narrow path to the shore, where, over a concrete seawall, we saw the very end of the shrine - a single Torii gate, perched onto a rock about twenty metres into the water. It wasn't as grand as some we'd seen at Senso-Ji, and if it had been painted originally - it wasn't clear - it'd had long been completely stripped off and the gate was now grey. But it looked really cool, some sort of spiritual gateway in and out of Japan. Apart from the beautiful gate, the rest of the scenery was very pretty, but the concrete wall - and the rain - almost reminded me of the UK. We had forty five minutes so we had a walk. The other occupants of the bus, who were all Chinese, decided to go straight back to the bus - I have no idea why. Having observed them on mass over the course of those two weeks, I concluded that they go places more to tick it off and say they've been rather than any actual enjoyment. I'd never travel if I didn't enjoy it.</p>
                        <img src={Day5Pic2} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>We explored the main road, with charming wooden buildings and some more modern shops and places. We stopped off at a nice looking hotel to get some coffee and check out the view from the panelled windows. We sat in the dining room staring out onto the rocks, and I don't know what it was about the decor, but it also sort of reminded me like an old hotel or cafe in an English seaside town. But it was a nice place and the view was lovely. We headed back, getting temporarily lost and being a couple of minutes late to the bus, something that would be a bit of a theme for that day.</p>
                        <p>Our next stop was Nakaminato Fish Market for lunch, and Steph was practically mouthwatering at the prospect. Unfortunately for me, my appetite was still completely nonexistent. As we expored the single road that comprised the market, Steph grabbed loads of small bites, one of the main stars being hand-shucked oysters. Near the end of the road there was a conveyor belt sushi bar tucked neatly at the back of a wholesale fishmongers, and boy do I regret not having an appetite for this place. Steph ate her fill while I think I had a small sashimi and a matcha or something similar. Then we went back, me heading to the coach as I was feeling rough, Steph down the other end of the road for a smaller fruit market.</p>
                        <img src={Day5Header} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>I had time for a bigger sleep on the way to Hitachi Seaside Park itself, which we got to after around an hour's drive. It's a curious place. On the one hand, it's not too dissimilar from a seaside theme park back home, with rides, arcades, and stuff to eat. On the other hand it also has so much more, like huge flower gardens of amazing regional and seasonal favourites, lots of green space, and an ampitheatre. Being late May/early June it wasn't exactly the start of the season yet, and the place was more or less deserted. Steph went to find a toilet and I explored the amusements. They had a small selection of games, all of them classics - basketball, skeeball, and a shooting range. I headed straight to the shooting range and got given these little corks which I loaded onto the airgun. I don't know why, but that first try was all it took, though the magic never came back. On like my third shot I hit the major bullseye, and got given a selection of prizes. I chose one pillow-sized toy that looked a bit like Pikachu's face. Steph burst out laughing when she saw me with it; she'd only left me alone for five minutes.</p>
                        <img src={Day5Pic3} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>We walked around and played more games, enjoying ourselves. Unfortunately none of the flowers were really in season, but we walked around and found our way to a surprisingly large ampitheatre on the other side. I have no idea why it was there, but I assume they have summer concerts or something when the place is in season, which is insanely cool.</p>
                        <p>I slept the duration of the trip back, waking up when we'd got into the city proper. I'm glad I slept, because it gave me enough energy for our evening plans. My birthday present from Steph had been dinner at Fushikino, a delightful Michelin-star restaurant in Shinjuku that offered a kaiseiki meal (lots and lots of plates) with a sake pairing. We'd been really looking forward to it, though I was worried about my appetite and being in a place where I couldn't wear a mask. I felt a pang of guilt of possibly infecting people (in case I was contageous, or still contageous after a couple of days) but we couldn't cancel without losing lots of money and for the last four years so many people had been walking around and eating dinner with open symptoms, so I can reconcile that slightly ethics-wise.</p>
                        <p>It was a beautiful place, small and minimalist, but it's the kind of sleek traditional minialism that stands for pure class. The waitress was very nice, and I hope I didn't give her a bug. We tucked into, I think, around eleven plates, and even with my appetite and my taste buds suppressed I couldn't describe them as anything other than delicious. We started off with abelone, watercress and asparagus, then moved onto shrimp dumplings, abrame and red snapper, grunt fish that had been dried overnight, swordfish, several different platters of wonderful seafood and shellfish, and miso. Each of them were expertly paired with a delicious sake. Of the eleven dishes, I was starting to seriously struggle wtih fullness. But by the middle of the course, the chef had come to watch us eat. You're really supposed to fawn over the food and proclaim that it's the best thing you've ever tasted when the chef comes to inspect you, which was not a tough sell for either of us. The chef seemed delighted im a stern way, and there was lots of mutual bowing at the end of our meal.</p>
                        <p>It was our last night in Tokyo (well, until the return leg) and in any other situation we'd have made use of the time as it wasn't that late. But I was on death's door, and we were both incredibly full after the keiseikei, so we went to bed.</p>

                            <p>I woke up slightly improved from yesterday morning, but still feeling mostly like death. Today we'd be taking the Shinkansen, the bullet train, from Tokyo to Kyoto. It was scheduled for 5pm so we still had more or less a full day in Tokyo. We decided to start our day with what we'd originally planned for day one - the Dawn Avatar Robot Cafe, a cafe where you're served by robots. I was pleased to note that my fogginess diminished quickly once I was up and about, but it never went away entirely.</p>
                            <img src={Day6Pic1} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="portraitPictures" />
                            <p>We got to the Dawn Avatar Robot Cafe. It really is a very cool place. The guy who runs it was a Hikikomori, which if you're a normal person won't mean nuch to you but in Japan's youth culture (and internet culture in general) a hikikomori is someone who seals themselves in their bedrooms for long periods at a time, having no social interaction and getting completely immersed in anime, games, or something else. It's a sort of cry for help against what is often quite a grim future for Japanese teenagers, a life of sixteen-hour days and <i>karoshi</i>, which is basically summarised as 'death by overwork'. Most kids go through their hikikomori phase for a few months or a year at most, but this guy was hikiko for <i>four years</i>. That's like a sentence of solitary confinement.</p>
                            <img src={Day6Pic2} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="portraitPictures" />
                            <p>But what he did at the Dawn Avatar was nothing short of amazing. He turned his own experience and thought of an idea for people who are lonely and isolated to both engage with people and get paid for it. The robots are piloted by these people from afar and they talk to you while you're eating and drinking, and everything is translated. We started off with a girl who had some rare syndrome, then the poor thing got too nervous and disconnected, and we talked to another woman. She didn't seem hard up for companionship, and she'd seemed to live an interesting life. She'd once bussed it from London to Edinburgh in what sounded like an amazing period of travelling, and had seen quite a bit of Europe. But she had to go speak to another table, so we ended up making conversation with a British (by way of South Korea) guy who was nearing the end of his travels. Steph ordered a snack but I stuck with coffee, my appettite not quite having come back. We wished him well and headed out. We still had quite a bit of time so we decided to go to one place that had consistently made us happy in Tokyo - Akihabara.</p>
                            <p>Akihabara is an amazing place to spend time at. We hit the department stores again, and this time I was keen that I wanted to buy some playing cards. We headed to the place that had had Yu-Gi-Oh cards, as I wanted to buy some. I realised that the cheapo ones in the cases were actual individual cards, but I stil brought some and they're still in the study to this day!</p>
                            <p>Next we hit the amusements, having an awesome time on the shooters and the beat machines. By mid afternoon we were making our way back, getting to Tokyo Central Station in enough time for the Shinkansen. Steph, in addition to maxing out her navivgation skills, had also maxed out her observational skills to contact Kloot, the booker, to make sure that we had the correct station as it wasn't particularly clear on the ticket. Soon we were settled into our seats and on the way, the train picking up high speed as soon as we left the station. But it's not like we were shuddering along the line; the train is so sleek and so stable that you don't feel a thing as you shoot past the countryside, the quickness of the view being the only thing to remind you that you're ginog incredibly fast. The scenery was very nice, but - quite involuntarily - I fell asleep very quickly. Steph stayed awake, hoping to catch a view of Mount Fuji at the 42-minute mark, which unfortunately she wasn't able to see due to the visibility The other reason was of course the slim possibility of missing the train, which I wish I could say had gone through my fever-addled ind as I slept.</p>
                            <img src={Day6Header} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>One good thing was that we didn't have our suitcases with us. Japan has a world-class baggage delivery service that we used several times across our trip. Our cases had left from the hotel before we'd left and would be joining us in Kyoto tomorrow. The guys who operated the services had really cool green uniforms that were always meticulously pressed and smoothed. If it was in the UK, it would be run by white van men smoking fags as they threw the suitcases into the loading area, smashing anything valuable inside. </p>
                            <p>As it was, I woke up some time before Kyoto, enough to see us pull into Nagoya, a fairly major regional city. From there it was only around half an hour to Kyoto proper, and we got out and headed towards our new accomodation.</p>
                            <p>I'd expected Kyoto to be a lot quieter than Tokyo, and of course it was, but the station wasn't. We jumped on a bus to our hotel just as it was getting dark, and we realised that the hotel was part of the Teramachi Shopping Arcade, a major covered shopping area bustling with people. It seemed to have everything, and I imagined it would be quite hard to navigate. We checked in and were given a room on the ninth floor, which to us suggested 'room with a view'. Ours was called something different to the other rooms on the floor, which were numbered; I think it was called the kabuki room or similar. It was considerably bigger and better than our hotel in Shibuya, but that wasn't the selling point - the decor was amazing. The room was accented by red lanterns and pleasant wall paintings, and the screen in front of the window resembled an Edo-era painting. The room looked clean and the bed looked comfy, and that was perfect for us.</p>
                            <p>We also checked out something that the receptionist had mentioned, which was the reading room on the second floor. This was a really cool area that I would have spent so much more time in if we were on a longer holiday and spending more time in Kyoto - and if I could read Kanji. Because while there were English books, the main feature of the room was a startlingly huge collection of manga. There were shelves stuffed full of the stuff, and I felt myself wondering (and not for the first time) why hotels in the UK can't have things like this?</p>
                            <p>We headed out into Teramachi, walking around the stalls and shops and looking for a place to get some food or drink. I actually had something resembling an appetite for the first time in the last few days, but it was quite late and not a lot of places were open, including a place that shut the lights off as soon as they saw us looking at the menu outdoors. So we decided to head to the 7-11 round the corner of the hotel and get some food and a couple of beers. Supermarkets, and especially 7-11, are amazing in Japan and have all sorts of bespoke food and drink. We grabbed a few cans of Sapporo beer and a couple of delicious meat dishes each as well as some desert, then headed to the room. There was an anime on the TV, sans subtitles, and we had fun trying to discern what was going on. We had some beers and then the food, then got some sleep.</p>

                            <p>We woke to a hot and sunny Kyoto morning. I still woke up feeling like crap, as I did alot around this time, but it was dying down quicker and quicker and for the most part the bug was over. Better still, we got notified that our bags were ready, and we headed down reception to bring them up. Then we got ready and headed out to one spot we'd been keen to see and was only a short walk away - the Samurai and Ninja Museum. It was in a small nearby building that didn't stand out, but once we were inside it was a different story. The place was properly traditional with tatami mats and a minimalist look. Despite being minimalist, it wasn't sparse in detail. It had several samurai and ninja costumes dressed onto mannequins, as well as some weapon displays and lots of infomrative infomration on black boards. This was only a staging area; after a few of us had filled the room up the tour began. Our tour guide spoke good English with a lot of passion, and he told us about the development of the Samurai.</p>
                            <img src={Day7Pic9} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>I'd known about quite a lot about what he was talking about - the Sengoku Jidai, the famous war of the Samurai, but he provided lots more information that I'd had no idea of, such as the way power was distributed between the Shogun and the Emperor, and the <i>Kiri-sute gomen</i>, or 'right to strike', an archaic custom by which Samurai could demand a certain level of respect from peasants, normally pressing the forehead to the floor, and would be allowed to strike or even kill a peasant who showed significant disrespect. I was able to answer one of the random questions he threw around every once in a while - he'd asked what Ninjas would have looked like in their dress, and I pointed out that they'd dress like farmers and peasants rather than the elaborate stealth getups they're normally associated with.</p>                           
                            <p>Before long, we got to throw some ninja stars, something I'd been aware of before but was really excited about. Ninja stars - or shuriken - are seen as one of the tools of the trade of Hollywood ninjas but they were used alot in real life too. We had some turns throwing them against the wall, and we couldn't quite make ours land for the most part but it was still a lot of fun. After that we got to the last room, which was really cool - the ability to pose with swords and armour. The armour was mostly plastic replicas but the swords were a mixed bag, from bamboo blades to actual blunted steel katanas. The steeel katans were heavy in a way I didn't quite expect, but they were really cool and we got some good photos.</p>
                            <img src={Day7Pic1} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>As we headed out we read some of the information pieces, and I was drawn to one item - foreign-born Samurai. It was all the gaijin in history that had achieved a Samurai or near-Samurai rank. There was Yasuke, the African Samurai, but my eyes were drawn to William Adams - and it didn't take me long to realise that I knew his story well, including the title he was given in Japan - Anjin. Before going to Japan we'd been watching <i>Shogun</i>, a show set at the end of the Sengoku period. When I'd first watched it, I'd initially had no idea it was based on a book by James Clavell. Now I didn't realise that the show, and the book, was based on a true story. I was excited, not just because I was gonna read more about his story but also because I'd be able to identify who the real life inspiration was for Yoshii Toranaga, the Anjin-Sama's lord, played amazingly by Hiroyuki 'the only man I would ever accept as a recast for Mister Miyagi' Sanada. I quickly got an answer for that on the poster - a name I was fairly familiar with but in reality knew nothing about. Tokugawa.</p>
                            <p>If you've ever played the <i>Civilization</i> games, or done a basic shallow dive of Japanese history, you may know the name Tokugawa. The name is presented as a direct character name in Civilization and I always thought that it was a one-word name, like Timur or Hannibal. Wrong on both counts - Tokugawa isn't a single name, and it isn't a person's name - it's a family name. In Japan, especially prior to the Meiji Period but even for some people today, the surname goes before the first name. It's a bit like Rome - 'Julius' was his family name. The Tokugawa in question, whom I'm pretty sure was the representation of wherever I've seen the name, is Tokugawa Ieyasu. From the information I could find, as well as later on, he'd been the father of the Edo period with his victory against Sekigahara, which I realised Shogun was building up to.</p>
                            <p>We went to get some lunch after the museum, me itching with excitement to have unlocked something to read more into. We stopped off at a great looking ramen shop, having a bone broth ramen that was so salty it blew through my sickly sinuses pleasantly. I had my phone out throughout, reading everything I could about the house of Tokugawa. I found out that Nijō Castle, their ancestral home, wasn't far away on the bus and Steph didn't take much convincing to go see a cool-looking castle.</p>
                            <img src={Day7Pic2} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>It must have been at least thirty degrees when we arrived outside Nijō, so we were glad to get inside the walls where there was more shade. It was a very large, imposing castle, the total compound probably being larger than a few football pitches. As you got closer to the main castle there was a surprisingly sharp incline. We walked up it with higher ground on either side, the kind where archers would tear you to bits from on high if you dared to invade.</p>
                            <img src={Day7Pic3} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="portraitPictures" />
                            <p>We were able to go into the castle proper, but the no-shoes rule was strict (as it should be, with antique tatami matting) and we couldn't take any photos. The place was immediately visually striking, coming straight out of a scene of the show, with corridors naturally full of intrigue and whispers. The corridors were, and this is a word I'll probably use a lot during this retelling, 'Peak Japanese'. The minimalistic class was palpable, a space that was devoid of ornamentation and clutter but was rendered far more beautiful as a result. If this was an English castle or stately home, a corridor such as this would be stacked to the roof with antique vases, busts of great generals or ancient heads of the family, or huge tapestries just tucked into corners. I'm not saying that isn't beautiful in its own way, but in Japan you can achieve an equally striking effect with tatami, shoji (that famous wood and sheet wall and door style Japan is famous for) and some beautiful painted motifs.</p>
                            <img src={Day7Pic4} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>Throughout the tour of the castle we saw informational boards that told small snippets of Tokugawa family history. The Tokugawa Shogunate lasted for just under three hundred years, and their reign basically was the Edo period. It all ended when the Shogunate was dissolved in the 1870s during the Meiji Restoration, which would create an unbroken line putting power back in the Emperor all the way to Hirohito in WW2. Like all history, the castle's official version tended to skew in favour of the family, inclding a few things that I know call willfully incorrect. And you're right - here I put away my journaliing hat and put on my geek hat. The impression I got from the castle's history was that the Tokugawa clan surrendered their power and ushered in the Restoration as some sort of act of both sacrifice and political savvy. The truth is that they were one hundred percent forced to do so by the Boshin war. The second major thing that I've since found out wasn't true was that the Restorationists were elitist cronies of the Emperor. And that falls apart as soon as soon as you learn who the biggest enemy of the Shogunate was: Saigo Takamori.</p>
                            <p>You know Takamori, even if you don't know him by name. He was the inspiration for Ken Watanabe's character in the <i>Last Samurai</i>, but that undersold the legend considerably. I'd wanted to learn more about Japanese history before going and while I hadn't got round to finding out that Tokugawa wasn't a person, I had done a deep dive into Takamori and I do think he's one of the most interesting people in Japanese history, a figure of absolute moral certainty and resistance to corruption, whose story was a lot more nuanced and interesting than the movie says. He wasn't some primitivist fundamentalist, he was a career general who had a concrete plan to resolve the troubles of both the country and the Samurai (granted it involved him committing suicide by rudeness in Korea to start a war, but it makes a lot of sense on paper) but who got disillusioned and rebelled.</p>
                            <p>The history hat back off, Nijō was truly an amazing castle. The rooms were completely minimalist, and yet spectacular and wonderful in their own way. The centrepiece was the audience room, the grandest room of all in the castle. It was designed for one purpose in mind - intimidation. The idea was that people who were called into audience with the Shogun would enter the room and be humbled by the imposing structure and grandeur, even though the grandeur was sharply minimalist. The room was completely bare, once again marked by shoji and tatami, with a dais where the Shogun would hold court, and a wall beautifully swathed in Edo-period paintings and murals. I'd have been intimidated holding an audience with a Tokugawa.</p>
                            <p>The rest of the castle was very beautiful also, and I truly regret not being able to take pictures, though pictures can never capture the true beauty of a place anyway. Some of the rooms had mannequins in them dressed out in Edo-appropriate clothing and it really put you in mind of how the place must have been back in that era.</p>
                            <img src={Day7Pic5} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>After we explored the castle, it was time to explore the gardens. The castle was surrouned by grey combed earth but beyond the immediate walls there are some of the lushest gardens you can imagine. We walked through taking in the tranquil atmosphere, imagining being a couple of Tokugawas walking through discussing philosophy back in Edo times. The place was lined with Japanese pines swaying gently in the breeze, pagodas and small ponds and lakes. It was such a bright open spot, resplendent in its beauty, but the bright sunshine was sullied by the thick raincloud in the distance.</p>
                            <img src={Day7Pic6} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>This was worrying on any day, but today it was extra concerning. We were going to Kifune Restaurant tonight just outside of Kyoto. It's a beautiful restaurant that is on an active river bridge. The reason we were worried is because if there's rain, the dinner moves inside, and the inside is option is just a dull modern dining room.</p>
                            <p>Our hopes were dashed when we got back to the center of town. The rain was torrential. It was coupled by vicious thunder and lightning and it was the kind that was so fierce it pulverised on the ground and turned to steam. We did a quick weather check - it wasn't due to stop raining until the early hours.</p>
                            <p>We made a snap judgement - there was no way we could go. We'd be compromising the proper dining experience, and subjecting ourselves to the most miserable conditions both there and back. THe problem was, cancellation is seen as an unbearable social transgression in Japan, and they are wont to charge you punishingly for skipping out. Therefore, we did a slightly questionable thing and decided to say I wasn't feeling well - which was true, had been for the last few days, and would definitely be exacerbated by travelling in the heavy rain - but was definitely not the reason why we weren't going.</p>
                            <p>We decided that Steph would make the call at reception's phone. I hung out awkwardly in the little ground floor area on our side of the road to reception - our block of rooms was all in the one block, but the reception was across the road - waiting while Steph delivered the news. Normally there'd be no reason in the world to hang back, but Japan's a nation of rule-followers and dishonesty is tantamount to theft. </p>
                            <p>During this moment of introspection, I happened upon an interesting tidbit. In the tiny (and I mean like five square foot) space with the two lifts and the main door, there was also a random door to the left. I decided to try it - and found myself in the Family Mart from yesterday! I'd known they were part of the same building as the hotel, but I loved this random bit of convenience. I couldn't resist wowing Steph with it. She came back and said all was well, and that she fancied grabbing a couple more Sapporo beers while we waited out the rain and decided what we were gonna do for the evening. Trying to avoid giggling with glee, I told her I wanted to grab something from upstairs first. She was annoyed, saying let's just go to Family Mart first, but I wouldn't be deterred - and I saw her face change from irritation to wonder when the door opened to that very shop, like some sort of retail Narnia.</p>
                            <p>We grabbed a couple of cans and headed upstairs to plan our evening. It was a little bit before the rain cooled off and by then we'd decided on a plan of action for the evening: We'd go to the food area outside of Kyoto Station for a bite to eat, then we'd head to the reading room on the second floor to check out the books. It was a suitably low-key evening for a wet rainy night.</p>
                            <p>Kyoto Station has a large food court just outside of the main station concourse. We'd spotted it on the way in. We headed back that way avoiding the rain and decided on an Omurice place. Omurice is a Japanese omlette stuffed with rice and other ingredients. We got it as a takeaway, going back to the reading room which was the only place in the hotel that had a microwave. Steph heated hers up and went to go eat upstairs, but I didn't heat mine up straight away - I wanted to do some reading. I picked up a chunky volume of Samurai history and went straight to the Sengoku period, wanting to find out more about the rise of Ieyasu, Sekigahara and what happened next. I went up after a little while and we watched some more of that anime program, still guessing at what was going on but enjoying ourselves anyway. </p>

                        <div>
                            <p>Today we were going to one of the major sights of Kyoto and, really, one of the must-sees of Japan; the Arashiyama Bamboo Forest. You'll invariably see pictures of it in a Japanese slideshow. It's meant to be incredibly peaceful to walk through, and it has loads of shrines, temples and gardens as reward for the walk. We had to get up early first, though, as we were changing hotels. We'd planned to spend two nights at a regular hotel in Kyoto and two at a Ryokan. A Ryokan is a type of traditional Japanese inn, a traditional house turned into a hotel. They were sort of reminiscent of Riads that we'd stayed at in Morocco, and they'd been a great option for the most part. We headed over to drop our bags off, and soon found ourself on a pleasant suburban street slightly further out from the centre of Tokyo but still in a very nice area. The Ryokan itself was very pleasant both from the outside and the inside. We came into a spacious lobby with katanas on display and an entranceway lined with decorative bamboo stalks. </p>
                            <p>The staff, including the owner, were very nice and had a great vibe, and my poor attempts to speak the bare minimum of Japanese went down well. We had to drop our bags off at reception as the room was understandably not ready, then we got the tram over to Arashiyama. Before we left, we decided to book our keiseikei meal for that evening, similar to that place back in Tokyo. Ryokans are famous for these, especially in Kyoto.</p>
                            <p>The road leading to Arashiyama was packed out, but we weren't that worried, as the crowds never seemed to get far into the forest. We headed in and were immediately wowed by the incredible scenery. A bamboo forest is so fundamentally different - and alien - to what you'd expect from a forest. For one, it's got a sense of rigid order, like everything else in Japan. The trees, for trees is what they are even though they look like thick poles, have a sense of formation and regimentation to them. The bamboos were leafy at the top, and while the trees didn't have branches or thick foliage, there were so many of the bamboos that the canopy was surprisingly thick. This was great for us, because today was at least thirty degrees, and while it was swelteringly humid, being even slighty sheltered from the sun was a bonus. One of our first major ports of call was Tenryū-ji, a beautiful temple overlooking a small lake. It had this amazing sense of tranquility about it, even with the crowds, and we walked around it, taking in the beauty. Once we were done, it was time to explore the rest of the forest.</p>
                            <img src={Day8Pic5} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="portraitPictures" />
                            <p>There were several temples dotted around this early part of the forest, but as we got further in, they became less and less frequent, same as the people. The majority of the people we'd seen at the entrance hadn't got very far in; like a lot of people, they'd taken a few steps in, taken some photos, then gone on to do something else. It's a shallow way of travelling as far as I'm concerned, but to each their own.</p>
                            <img src={Day8Pic6} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>As we completed quite a respectable walk, my legs creaking but much stronger than the last few days, we headed back towards the entrance. We were hungry and had some other stops to visit. We found lunch at a place nearby that did Okonomiyaki. Okonomiyaki is a savoury pancake very popular in Japan, and something Steph's made to my delight at home. It's primarily flavoured with a delicious sauce made of Worcester sauce (so, not an ancient recipe there), sugar, ketchup and oyster sauce. Like other places we'd been to, they have a grill at your table where they make the pancake in front of you. So that means you know it's delicious and fresh, but it also made the place an absolute hotbox. We wolfed down our food then got the bus back into town. Our next stop was the Gion district, and especially an intersection of two famous roads, Ninenzaka and Sannenzaka. You'll have seen one of them before in pictures, they're some of the best-preserved Edo streets in Japan, kept painstakingly unaltered. When you'll have seen them, it's invariable that they'll have been quite empty, their solitude disturbed only by an occasional kimono-clad wanderer.</p>
                            <img src={Day8Pic1} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>Anyone who's based their trip to Kyoto, or worse Japan, on a tranquil and serene picture of these two streets is setting themselves up for a bitter disappointment. It's not that they're not beautiful, because of course they are. The houses, the shopfronts, and the cobblestones are all incredible to look at, but rather than solitude, you have a wall of tourists so thick that Donald Trump would envy it. The place is absolutely rammo and we had to fight for an inch of space. I have a vivid recollection of a Chinese tourist (who else?) pushing past Steph, me balling my fists up before Steph reminded me what a stupid idea it would be to start a fight in a foreign country, especially Japan with its zero-tolerance approach to antisocial behaviour. So I waited until he'd set up the perfect photo with his family, then slowly and deliberately walked through the camera view giving him the eye until the crowd shifted and he'd lost his focus. Petty? Definitely, but the pettiest revenge can sometimes be the most satisfying.</p>
                            <img src={Day8Pic2} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>The crowds aside, the place really was beautiful, and as we walked we were really thrown back in time. There are fewer and fewer places like Ninenzaka and Sannenzaka in the UK. London's got plenty of well-preserved streets but they're so central, not to mention not pedestrianised, that you'd never believe you were anywhere but the modern world. Smaller cities like Winchester have brilliantly-preserved Medieval areas but you never know when they'll stick a random Dominos into a Tudor terraced house, ruining the effect. Ninenzaka and Sannenzaka aren't that old, but their owners, or possibly the local council, have been extremely diligent in making sure they stay in place. Of course, that doesn't mean that there are no modern shops; the place has a Starbucks, for example. But it's in a perfectly maintained Edo house and does't look out of place at all. At the direct intersection of the two roads there's the Yasaka Pagoda, a tall and imposing monument that dominates the mostly-flat Gion district. Even surrounded by thousands of people, you can't help but be wowed by it.</p>
                            <img src={Day8Pic3} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>It was coming close to our booked keiseikei meal, so we decided to head back. While the area immediately around our ryokan was very peaceful and Kyoto-esque, we realised when coming back that we were fairly close to quite a major, busy intersection that looked like it was at the city limits. We got in and got sha favourown the room. </p>
                            <img src={Day8Pic7} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>I think when we go back to Japan (when) we'll definitely spend time at ryokans. This one was on the small size compared to others we'd seen, but it was still one of the coolest places I've stayed at. It was more like a tiny, minimalist apartment than a room. It only had a living room/bedroom combo, a bathroom, and a toilet, but they were all on one corridor that made it seem larger than it probably was. One key thing that deliniated it from a hotel room was the large step between the corridor and the carpeted route from the hallway.</p>
                            <p> This is a feature of Japanese living spaces. It's designed to avoid the blurring of public floor space and private floor space that happens in western housing. In our house, for example, we normally take our shoes off at the door, but then we'll tread over that same spot in our home slippers, or we might carry shopping bags into the kitchen with our shoes still on. The reason for this is because for us there are only two zones for us: outside the house and inside the house, and once you're in, only a fresh clean will keep the spread of outdoor shoes from the interior. In Japanese homes, that have the large step, the lowered entranceway is for all of the stuff that we'd just do in our hallway, like carrying bags in before we take our shoes off. Then once we come to the raised step, it becomes a <i>strict</i> no shoe zone.</p>
                            <p>That living room and bedroom combo was the crux of our living space - the other two rooms were just essentials. It was a room about as wide as our bedroom at home and considerably shorter, but the use of space made it seem three times as big. You had the beds, which were two small futons that made it indistinguishable from sleeping on the floor, but which nonetheless gave an amazingly comfortable sleep - and I say that as a back pain sufferer. We joked afterwards about getting rid of our bed at home and converting the whole room into a replica of our Ryokan but I'm bang up for it. The room was shoji-panelled, but it was a lightweight sliding construction in front of what was otherwise a modern window. Others may have stayed there and thought 'artificial'. I thought 'cool, I can make that in Hurst Green'.</p>
                            <p>We went for our keiseikei dinner downstairs, and it was amazing. The canteen was relatively modernist considering the rest of the ryokan but the food was incredible, and so was the sake. There was salmon, tuna, wagyu, and a huge lineup of amuse bouches. We were completely full afterwards, and very content.</p>
                            <p>The evening was winding down for Steph, but not for me. This ryokan, like others like it, had an onsen, which is a traditional Japanese form of bathing. We've done traditional bathing before - the hotsprings in Iceland, the sauna and icy Fjord-air in Norway, the hamam in Istanbul - but onsens are always going to be a favourite - for me at least; Steph didn't do it.</p>
                            <p>The onsen at the ryokan was one of the best bathing experiences in my life, other than the fact that you have to be naked around strangers, which doesn't matter much. I deposited my stuff im a little cubby before heading into the main onsen room.</p>
                            <p>It has two pools, both about twice as big as a bath, as well as several showering spots and stools. You're supposed to have your proper wash in these then enjoy the actual bath for leisure, which is kinda similar to how hamams work. I washed then lowered myself into one of the two large tubs. It was hotter than a bath, but not scalding, and I felt every single ounce of soreness from our long travel day melt away in the tub. I also felt a strong sense of danger - even without the bellyful of sake I'd had, it was ridiculously relaxing, and if I'd fallen asleep, it would have been easy to drift off and slip into the deep water, which unlike a bath could easily drown a person.</p>
                            <p>I laid there for what felt like forever, letting the cares of the world wash away from me. I thought of nothing. There was only the onsen, the amazing healing waters that soothed every bit of my essence. We were on the top floor and there was a view, but it was completely obscured by steam and condensation. So I stared into space, completely enveloped in my own comfort.</p>
                            <p>I had to head out after a while and I dried off, heading back upstairs. We settled into our futons, which were extremely comfortable despite being bare, and got what was probably one of the best nights' sleep we got in a long time.</p>

                            <p>It had been such a brief stay in Kyoto, but today was our last day. We were going to hit some more sights today and get our fill of the culture. My morning grogginess since the start of my illness had taken a slight turn for the worse, and I had an idea to cut through it: a morning onsen. I headed upstairs, having a quick wash before diving back into that amazing water. The view was slightly more visible during the day but the condensation still obscured the view from the most part.</p>
                            <p>It turned out to be a bit of a mistake. The onsen left me so relaxed and meditative that it was ridiculously hard for poor Steph to shift me, and I was still in a blissful groggy state once we were out of the door. </p>
                            <img src={Day9Pic1} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>Our first stop was the <i>Kinkaku-ji</i>, a dazzlingly bright and beautiful temple covered in gold leaf paint. It's amazing and elaborate, and the gold shines gently against the perfectly crystalline lake that surrounds it. It's a beautiful sight.</p>
                            <img src={Day9Pic2} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>Next up, we got a bus over to Sanjūsangendō Temple in the Higashiyama Ward. In the local parlance this is known as the Temple of a Thousand Buddhas. So called because, quite obviously, it has a thousand Buddha statues. They're not actually Buddhas; they're Kannon, the Buddhist diety of compassion. Each of these was brass or another metal and had a halo made of sharp implements of the same. We weren't allowed to take pictures, and that's fine, because like most of what we saw in Japan photos fall very short of the mental picture. You go into a vast hall with endless versions of the same statue, with one huge statue in the middle.</p>
                            <img src={Day9Header} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>It was an amazing sight, a testament to pure faith. My mind is baffled that faith could compel someone to either create or commission a thousand versions of the same statue. It was also very creepy. The room was dark, and I was immediately put into the mind of the Weeping Angels from Doctor Who. I had a vivid idea of walking all the way down, staring at the statues, then one turns around to look at you before the entire procession come to life.</p>
                            <p>But we got to the end of the imposing procession without any Whovian incidents, marvelling at the sights and reading all about the different Buddhist deities. I must admit a venomous dislike of Buddhism; they're responsible for every single problem in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and a dozen or so other places in Asia, all while seeming like the religion of chill in the minds of what our old friend Trotsky would have called useful idiots. I let a lot of bile seep into that sentence, but to simplify, I'm not a fan. But I look at places like Sanjūsangendō and I think wow, what a testament to faith, even if I'm not a fan of the faith in question. My exact attitude to St Peter's Basilica.</p>
                            <img src={Day9Pic4} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>We had a couple more major stops to make on our Kyoto cultural tour, the Yasuka Shrine, a huge cultural icon that reminded both of us of the Senso-Ji temple with its bold red roof. From there, it was a short bus ride to the major feature of the day: the Fushimi Inari shrine. This is less a singular temple and more of a large park on Inari mountain, with one unique selling point: every inch of the walking path around the mountain was crossed by Torii gates. There must be thousands of them at a gap of no more than a foot or so, and I can only think of it as an act of inspired madness that ordered their construction. My brain absolutely boggles when I think of how long it must have taken to build, and how difficult it must have been to build on such an incline.</p>
                            <img src={Day9Pic3} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>We made our way up, marvelling at the gates as we passed through them. Every single one was a work of beauty, painted the exact same red-orange tone and perfectly carved. The level of detail that went into every single one of the gates was immense, and did not deteriorate regardless of altitude.</p>
                            <img src={Day9Pic5} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>The views were spectacular even from a lower point on the mountain, and we got a great view of Kyoto as the late afternoon sun reddened. It was a flat city, but not as flat as you might expect if, like me, you assumed that the Gion District basically made up all of Kyoto. Another plus point of the hike as we got higher up was the cats; they went from a few to a full pack. I wanted to stroke them, but even though Japan's rabies cases are basically null and void, I remembered the stress I'd had after getting bitten by that cat at the Acropolis.</p>
                            <img src={Day9Pic6} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>There was more to go, but we were lagging, me moreso because I was still a bit ill. So after a long while we headed back down to base camp. The sun was in the final stages of setting by the time we got down and for the first time today the temperature had dropped under thirty degrees.</p>
                            <img src={Day9Pic7} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="portraitPictures" />
                            <p>We were closing on our time in Kyoto but we had one major spot left to go. Pontocho Alley is one of the most happening nightlife areas in Kyoto, and is full of bars, restaurants, and things to do. Unlike the other nightlife areas we'd see - Shibuya, Shinjuku, Ginza, Susukino - it didn't really have a seedy side, but the only problem was that it was absolutley heaving. It was much busier even than Ninenzaka and Sannenzaka, and navigating the narrow alley was difficult. We didn't go for a restaurant - we'll cover why shortly - but we stopped off in a traditional little tavern for a couple of sakes. It wasn't too expensive even despite it being a major tourist spot, and we enjoyed ourselves before heading back.</p>
                            <p>The reason we weren't going to get food was because we had a plan for our last night in Kyoto. There was a Family Mart nearby that had had some excellent sushi on display, and our plan was a private keiseikei meal in our room with sushi, sake, and the yukatas - a robe-like kimono - we got with the room.</p>
                            <p>We had a litle sushi feast and drank good sake, just the two of us. I went to the onsen afterwards and tried to convince Steph to try it, but she was slightly less enthused with public nudity than I was, not that I particularly was. I headed up and gave myself one final soak, hoping that I'd be able to get an onsen in Hokkaido. I didn't, as it goes.</p>

                        <div>
                            <p>It was a big day of travel today. We were going to get the train to Osaka, then a short internal flight to Sapporo,. We were going from the south island to the north, into the great white (or currently green) open.</p>
                            <p>We checked out relatively early, dropping our bags off with the baggage couriers with the immaculate green uniforms. We headed straight to Kyoto station, taking a train of just under an hour into Osaka.</p>
                            <p>We had a flight to catch, but we'd set it up to have a good few hours in Osaka beforehand. We started off by taking a subway towards Osakajo, a large park complex of which the epicentre was Osaka Castle. We were eager to see this - as mentioned, we'd been big fans of James Clavell's <i>Shogun</i>, and Osaka Castle was a makor location in that.</p>
                            <p>We walked through the park, which was a little peninsula broken up by subset canals of the Daini Neya River. It was at least 35 degrees and walking was very difficult, especially as the part of the park that contained the castle itself was on higher ground. As we got further, the castle itself wa obscured to us - until it came smack bang into view.</p>
                            <img src={Day10Pic1} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="portraitPictures" />
                            <p>When you first see Osaka Castle, it's so alien to what you understand to be a castle, especially if you're from the UK. If you are from this sceptic isle, you identify the vast majority of them as standardised grey stone fortification designed much more with defence in mind than style. Don't get me wrong; I love the look of English castles, especially Bodiam, but let's be perfectly fair; they're built that way for defence, not visuals. Osaka Castle is defensive too (though more against earthquakes than enemies) but it's incredibly ornate, with trimmings of gold leaf and bold colour patterns.</p>
                            <img src={Day10Pic2} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="portraitPictures" />
                            <p>Osaka Castle is another major location in Shogun, the narrative equivalent of the Death Star in that it's both a headquarters for the villains and a major focal point of action. We were eager to check it out inside, but that was before we saw the queue. It stretched back for at least half a mile, and we would have been waiting at least two hours to get in. That's a tough sell at the best of times, but we had precious few hours in Oskaa before our flight.</p>
                            <p>So we left the park and headed towards Dōtombori, the other of our agreed must-sees in Osaka. Dōtombori is insane. It's a food market. It's a party hotspot. It's Times Square. It's Picadilly Circus. It's a red light district. It's cyberpunk. It's Vegas. I don't think there's a single item, food or otherwise, I couldn't get in Dōtombori. We walked around, eating everything we could get our hands on, which included crab dumpling, chcicken yakitori, beef sushi (yes, it's a thing!), wagyu, frozen fruit with chocolate, and crab ice cream - it works!</p>
                            <img src={Day10Pic3} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="portraitPictures" />
                            <p>It was very busy, and I feel like in Osaka - which would also be a winter destination as well as a summer - it would be all year round. We could have stayed a lot longer, but we had a flight to catch, and we got the subway over to the airport.</p>
                            <img src={Day10Pic4} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="portraitPictures" />
                            <p>Things went very painlessly in terms of boarding - the fact that our suitcases were being ferried separately probably helped - and we were on a row of three with a woman with a baby on her lap. Japanese babies are ridiculously cute and this baby was no exception. He seemed fascinated by us, and we decided to try to entertain him with the arsenal of tricks we'd picked up to entertain Leo in his younger years - peekaboo, dunga dunga (a form of faux-Bollywood dance with mostly arm movements I pioneered, with the words "dunga dunga dunga dunga" impoosed over Panjabi MC's legendary unmistakeable (well, maybe not in Japan) beat for <i>Mundian To Bach Ke</i>) and a whole range of funny faces. He absolutey loved it, peeling into fits of adorable laughter. When we turned our attentions to our phones he grabbed at us in a way that could only be taken to mean 'I'm not done being entertained'.</p>
                            <p>He settled down to sleep after a while, but when he woke up crying, we definitely went up a few points in his mother's eyes by getting right back into performance mode, calming him down and getting him giggling again. His sister was watching all throughout, and looked jealous that her brothers had all the attenition.</p>
                            <p>It was altready getting dark by the time we got into the airport. There was no passport or security checks on the other side so we got straight to the train station and set off for the city.</p>
                            <p>We got a good look at this corner of Hokkaido out of the window, and it looked quite American in a strange way, maybe the northwest or Alaska, with huge pine forests and small towns that were little more than a few buildings stretching a deserted stretch of road. I know it would have looked amazing in winter, which it's known to be, but it looks pretty amazing in summer too. Then we arrived.</p>
                            <p>If I had to describe Sapporo, I'd say imagine if someone plonked Manhattan in the middle of Siberia. You don't expect Manhattan in Siberia. You expect a one-horse, decrepit city without much to say for iteself. But Sapporo looks very similar to a Japanised version of New York, with wide roads, city blocks, and just the general look and feel. It makes sense slightly in terms of design; Sapporo's one of the newest cities in Japan, being built in the mid 1800s, so it would make sense that it would follow city planning guidelines of the time and be organised among a modern grid. But the sheer size of it does't make sense; it's Japan's fifth largest city, a sprawling metrpolis set among rugged wilderness.</p>
                            <p>As we walked to our hotel, I noticed something - the temperature had plummeted from Osaka. Of course it had, we'd gone sharply north, but it was June and the temperature couldn't have been any higher than ten degrees in the early evening. It makes less sense when you realise that Sapporo is on the same latitude as Paris, and that overnight it would jump from almost freezing to almost thirty degrees.</p>
                            <p>Our hotel was a tall building about fifteen minutes' walk from the center of town. Our room was smaller than the ryokan and its opposite, being corporate and modern rather than traditional, but it was a nice, spacious room with a good view.</p>
                            <p>We headed out for some dinner. It was around nine now, and the temperature had dropped considerably. For Steph this was fine; she'd packed her hand luggage well, but I'd failed to anticipate the change in temperature and was wearing summer clothes, shorts and a t-shirt with the rest of my clothes coming in my hold luggage tomorrow morning. It was refreshing at first after the sweltering heat of Kyoto, but soon I was freezing.</p>
                            <img src={Day10Pic5} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>Sapporo is a sleek, modernist-designed city. It's got considerably less neon than Tokyo but still has an undeniably noirish feel, though less Blade Runner and more Gotham City.</p>
                            <img src={Day10Pic6} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>We headed to a sukiyaki restaurant downtown. Sukiyaki is a set of different plates that are cooked at the table. I ordered a tempura version whereas Steph went for the pure option. It was delicious and hearty for a cold summer winter's night, and we ate and headed back to a solid night's sleep.</p>

                        <div>
                            <p>While the temperature had been icy cold last nght, today it was - or felt anyIway - like thirty degrees. I've simply never seen that dramatic a temperature change in recent memory. The sunshine was very heavy, though thankfully unlike Kyoto it was a drier heat.</p>
                            <img src={Day11Pic1} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="portraitPictures" />
                            <p>Today we were going to see the city. We got some breakfast downstairs then headed out, Steph taking the lead navigation-wise. We were going to check out the Tokyo clock tower, Odori Park, and the Sapporo beer museum. The clock tower is a 19th century building near the center of town, and it's probably one of the oldest buildings in the city. It seemed to belong to a Scandinavian city, maybe Bergen or Tromso, and seemed to have quite an interested following. I quite liked the look of it, but Steph wasn't particularly impressed, so we headed over to Odori.</p>
                            <img src={Day11Pic2} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>Odori is a bit like Central Park - the New York parallels only increase - in that it's a rectangle that stretches lengthwise across several city blocks. Though unlike Central Park, it's fairly narrow, no wider than the city blocks that surround it. We headed into the misection of the park that offered a good view of the Sapporo TV Tower, an Eiffelesque structure that dominates the local view.</p>
                            <img src={Day11Pic3} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="portraitPictures" />
                            <p>One thing I was excited to try was Sapporo ice cream, and there was a stand in the park. Sapporo ice cream comes from Sapporo milk, which is very famous in Japan and elsewhere for its quality. The ice cream was delicious, and so (apparently) was Steph's corn on the cob, and we sat in the sun for a little while eating and people-watching.</p>
                            <p>Our next stop was a place we'd been meaning to go to from the beginning, a place called Mega Don Quijote. It's one of Japan's biggest discount stores and they have every single thing a person would need to get their hands on on short notice. Its connection to the literary Quixote? Probably none. It's a bright, jangly place with colourful mascots and a sort of considered, cultivated disorder. It's like a gigantic Lidl, but much nicer, with nicer clientele.</p>
                            <img src={Day11Pic4} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>We bought a good deal of our souvenirs as well as some food, like wagyu cheese, fine peaches, ramen, pistachio milk, and lots more. We headed back to the room to drop off the stuff, and Steph - against my mild complaints - booked us in for another excursion, this time to the nearby Shikotsu Toya National Park, as well as a bear sanctuary, Lake Toya, and Otaru.</p> 
                            <p>Once we'd dropped the stuff off, we headed to Sapporo Station, where we'd be catching a bus to the beer museum. Sapporo is one of Japan's best breweries, and we'd seen their products all over. In Japan, they're an Asahi-beater, but in the rest of the world, they're unknown.</p>
                            <img src={Day11Pic5} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>The brewery was a classic faded redbrick building that wouldn't be out of place in one of the nicer Engish industrial towns, back in the mid eighteenth century when industrialism meant somewhat neoclassical, well-built local factories instead of grim industrial buildings that would symbolise the age later on.</p>
                            <p>There was a paid tour but it seemed a bit of a ripoff, and the free tour looked pretty great. We took it, and started to learn the history of Sapporo brewing. It had all started with a Japanese guy who'd gone to Germany to train as a brewer, then once he was a master he went back to his native Sapporo to set up shop. It's a neat story, a real underdog classic even if the worlds 'Japan' 'Gernany' and 'master' are often used in a worse context. But the place was cool, and the exhibits that charted the rise of the brewery from its early beginnings to mass market distribution.</p>
                            <img src={Day11Pic6} alt="Day 2 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>We headed to the tasting room afterwards and had a couple of sampler glasses of the different Sapporo favourites, all of which were very yummy. After we were done sampling, we decided to head over to the beer hall that was part of the musem to get a few more drinks as well as some food.</p>
                            <p>The beer hall is designed based on the bavarian beer halls that the brewery's inventor must have enjoyed while he was learning to make the stuff, and as it had been constructed in the nineteenth century, it had an air of authenticity even as a cultural transplant.</p>
                            <p>There was food and lots of different beers and drinks on offer, and one thing that Steph in particular wanted to try was Jingisukan, translated into English (and Mongolian, I suppose) as Genghis Khan. It's a Mongolian mutton barbecue dish that was introduced during the Mongol invasion of Japan in the 12th Century, hence the name, but we ordered some sausages and I, very ill-advised, suggested an all-you-can-drink order. We agreed on a two-hour order and started getting the beers in.</p>
                            <p>In piecing together the next few hours, I have to purely restrict my accounting to things that I know. I know that my memory ends around the forty minute mark of the two hour drink window and resumes when I woke up hours later in what I first thought was a nightclub but what I quickly realised was our hotel room. I know that we somehow paid our bill. I know that we managed to both wait and pay for a bus. I know that we must have got off at the correct stop. I know that we, and by which I mean Steph, navigated us back to the room and managed to get us upstairs.</p>
                            <p>I know these things by virtue of our presence in our hotel bedroom, which for some reason I thought was a nightclub for the first few seconds after waking up. The two of us were proper messy, me moreso even than Steph, who had apparently set off in a drunken state trying to find the nearby Pokemon store before abandoning the chase and getting back into bed.</p>
                            <p>Naturally we went more or less straight to sleep after that, ready to brace an excursion - and a vicious hangover - tomorrow.</p>
                         </div>}

                        <div>
                            <p>I can't speak for Steph, but for me, it was worse than I imagined.</p>
                            <p>I can think of only a few times I've had a <b>serious</b> hangover on one of our proper holidays. The rest day we had in Helena after going to that bar. At least one Vegas night. But this must have beaten them all. We had to physically force ourselves out the door and towards the bus station for today's excursion, every step an exercise in self-inflicted agony. But the bus was relatively comfortable, and we settled near the back.</p>
                            <p>Unlike our last excursion, it was only half Chinese, and the rest of us were a combination of English, French and American, as well as some others. It may have been the hangover, but the Mandarin was starting to grate on me. I don't like Mandarin. I think Japanese is an elegant, beautiful-sounding language, and I would probably think the same about Korean, Tagalog, and Thai if I heard it more. But Mandarin is an ugly language, at least to my ears, that has too many unappealing <i>sh</i> noises made from equally unappealing mouth movements.</p>
                            <p>I don't mean to be harsh, and I certainly don't want to denigrate a language a billion people speak, but it sounds horrendous to my ears. Worse yet was a commmon word, meant to signify an 'um' or an 'uh': <i>nèige</i>, which sounds like a much nastier word out loud. One guy said it often, to our increasing cringe before (and even a bit after) we knew it was a perfectly-innocuous word. It's more severe in America, as all things are, where people are actually being suspended from college postings for using it in conversation.</p>
                            <p>We, or at least I, spent a good chunk of the journey to Shikotsu Toya desperately trying to sleep as much as possible. The hangover, as well as the residual illness, was better when I woke up near our destination. The first thing that signalled that we were entering a slightly unusual location was the massive demon statue that greeted our entrance to the park. We learned that as the park is swathed in hot springs it's known as the mouth of hell, the sulpher smoking and bubbling.</p>
                            <p>As we got into Noboribetsu, the town surrounded by the park, we saw several more devil statues. We also saw <i>Enma Daio</i>, a huge anamamatronic model of a judge who apparently did a show every half an hour where he transformed into the demon king who judged souls heading ot the afterlife. We started in the park proper, walking down the gangplank before being greeted by an incredible thermal vista. It reminded us of Yellowstone with its hot springs, but instead of small hot spring pockets isolated between large swathes of grassland, the whole landscape was morphed by the springs.</p>
                            <p>We knew, of course, from past experience why you have a gangplank and why you stick to it. The mud beneath will give way under gentle tread, which will submerge your foot in boiling hot water that will strip the skin off in seconds. The landscape is absolutey amazing though, the terrain pockmarked and beautifully warped by the volcanic features.</p>
                            <p>We explored the area then headed up the gangplank back into town, as the Demon King anamatronic show was about to start. We didn't kow what to expect, but it didn't disappoint. In front of a growing crowd, the huge - absolutely huge - anamatronic came alive, bringing up a scroll and making varied pronouncements in Japanese. The voicework was incredible, as well as the subtle face movements that made him look insanely realistic.</p>
                            <p>Then the transformation happened. The human head went into the gigantic torso, replaced by a demon's head with red skin and yellow eyes. He regarded the growing crowd with amused contempt, his eyes flashing and his voice turning malicious as he presumably read off divine judgements, condemning the dead to hell. It was quite psychadelic, but some of the younger kids in the audience didn't think so, and found the whole thing absolutely terrifying. But we enjoyed the show.</p>
                            <p>We had a leisurely walk around town then set off for our next stop on the excursion, a bear sanctuary. Bears are very common in Sapporo, and the refuge was a great place to get up close to them. We bought some bear cookies and headed in to see the bears themselves. They were in several large paddocks, seveeral bears to an enclosure. Like checking out refuges in Sri Lanka, you learn to look out for signs of poor treatment, and I can say it was a mix; some of the bears looked thinner, but I can't say if it was a case of poor nourishment or just breed. But what I do notice is the form of requesting (I say requesting, because it's not begging) treats that they have managed to perfect. It's oddly human in its movements. Some of them will go up on their hind legs, as if to say 'hey, I'm like you, give me a cookie'. Others will left their arms in a 'hey, over here' gesture. It's disturbingly recognisable, as is the dismissive way they look at you when you miss.</p>
                            <p>Not all the bears are serene. They've got the more aggressive bears in a smaller enclosure, and from their hungry looks and jagged claws we could tell for a fact that it was only a couple of centimeters of metal that stopped us from being the cookie. We went down and got to be in a sort of immersion pod, a small room where you can observe one of the bigger bear enclosures with only glass to protect you. The whole thing was really cool, and we got some immediate exposure to proper Sapporo bears, even if they'd spent most of their lives in captivity.</p>
                            <p>We headed out towards Lake Toya, me getting another quick nap along the way. We'd transitioned from hot springs to beautiful mountain scenery. We saw the lake stretch out ahead of us, shimmering beautifully in the sunlight. We stopped off by the shore for some photos, walking across the grassy coast and looking out. We walked out onto a small dock, which made Toya remind me of a lake we'd seen back in Yellowstone. </p>
                            <p>We stopped off at a small shop with wonderful views of the lake. They had lots of Sapporo milk products, including ice cream and this gorgeous yoghurt drink. We brought a few supplies and souvenirs then went out the back to enjoy our treats. It had a commanding view of the lake. On the other side, out the front, we got an incredible view of Mount Yotei, an active volcano. It's reminds me of Tolkien's Lonely Mountain because there was nothing that resembled it in the whole skyline. </p>
                            <p>We moved on before long, enjoying the scenery as we headed towards Otaru. Otaru is a gorgeous coastal town that's heavily European-inspired. It's known for its steam-powered clock, its glassworks, and its canal. We pulled into a car park by said canal and headed into town. Otaru has got a pretty, historic main road that's got niche shops and places to eat. It all looks very European, incluing quite a lot of British influences, but the glassblowing places - one of which we started off in - were very inspired by Reneissance-era Venice, right down to carnival masks.</p>
                            <p>The glasswork was very impressive, and was mostly in the form of animals. On the other hand, it looked very expensive too, and the staff looked like they were itching to enforce the 'you break it, you buy it' rule.</p>
                            <p>We headed out and explored the town, looking in all the shops. We grabbed some Yūbari melon, which Steph told me was mega famous, from a guy with a street stall. We went all the way down to see the steam clock, which was in front of the music box museum, a gothic building that looked very German. It would have been great to visit but we only had a couple of hours. Wen went to a cafe instead and had some cheesecake that was absolutely delicious. Then we took a short walk back to the carpark and got on the road.</p>
                            <p>I got some omre sleep on the drive back, which wasn't too long. Our guide was telling us about the Yosakoi Soran Festival, a big annual festival of light dances and colour, that was in town. We'd known there was something major going on from what we'd seen in the morning and last night, but we hadn't known what it was. When we pulled up we walked back over to Odori Park where it was taking place. The first thing we saw was a group of dancers wearing these amazing colourful, historical robes getting ready. There was music everywhere and as we walked through the park it became lined with food stalls. There was food from all over Japan, some we'd had before, some that was brand new. We walked around, eagerly sampling. If this event was in London each place would be corporate owned and would charge £15 upwards or anything but a small plate, but these were independent and very reasonable. We had as a rough list: wagyu skewers, deep fried meatballs, crisp towers, and purple potato ice cream, which Steph had and I didn't because it looked a bit bizarre.</p>
                            <p>The crowds were everywhere but it was a nice vibe, and everyone was having a good time. We walked through until we got to a makeshift stadium that had a queue in front of it and a big screen that showed the action. We considered joining the queue, but we had a great view of the big screen and there were lots of spots on the grass to lay down and enjoy.</p>
                            <p>The dance teams started up, and they were amazing. Their choreography was absolutely on point and the costumes were vivid and amazing. It also less fortunately gave me one of those 'reasons I hate England' thoughts that I get on holiday, normally when the flight home rears into view. I thought, and voiced, that something like this - a major city putting on a huge festival, with independent food stalls, and stadium entertainment that can either be watched for free in a nice setting or for cheap inside the stadium - wouldn't happen in the UK. There are council-run festivals here and there but they're few and far between, and designed to be geared towards profit only, with big expensive corporate stalls, £12 beer, and expensive parking. Maybe it's slightly different up north, but I do know that this - an event where the only goal is to make people happy - is not really a UK thing.</p>
                            <p>We stayed for about half an hour - it was getting very late, and cold outside. We took a short walk back to the room and passed out.</p>

                            <p>We woke up to our last proper day in Hokkaido, eager to make it last. We had a good few stops today that we wanted to hit. We wanted to go to a proper Pokemon store, which were a whole experience of their own out here. It was only a short walk away in a large department store. It looked very cool, with large Pokemon models and lots of choice. I brought what I thought were a deck of duelling cards, but turned out to be just a big pack of holders for individual cards. Still kept it, though.</p>
                            <p>Our bigger plan for the day was the Shiroi Koibito Park, an attraction that our guide had pointed out to us in the coach yesterday. It's a chocolate, or chocolate snack, factory, but there's a lot more than that. The whole compound is kitted out to resemble Tudor-era England, including several large faux-wattle and daub gabled buildings and an English country garden. It was built by a British architect, so it's more authentically English than, say, the Bellagio is authentically Italian. But it's still bizzare - that made three places we'd been to in Hokkaido (here, Otaru, and the beer museum) that were based on historical European architecture.</p>
                            <p>We took the bus there, gobsmacked to see such a place amid a modern city. It was a boiling hot day. We were hungry, and decided on a soup curry that's a Hokkaido speciality. I was a bit of a skeptic where the soup curry was concerned, especially once the smell hit. Since I'd got ill I'd been a lot less adventurous with good, and I initially considered fried chicken, but Steph vetoed that - I'd had a lot of it. So instead I got the soup curry - it was alright, but not a high point.</p>
                            <p>Once we'd eaten, we started off with the chocolate factor tour. Shiroi Koibito are a sort of white chocolate and filling snack, like a hard white rectangular Oreo or a chocalatey custard cream. They're not realy sold in the same way though; they're served as little treats on airplanes, in hotels and generally free. The tour involves a circular walk around the main producdtion floor, and it looks like a modernist Willy Wonka factory with its bright colours, uniforms and smooth operation. It was all very interesting, and we got a couple of the snacks themselves to eat. It was pretty good.</p>
                            <p>After the tour we headed to a chocalate shop downstairs and bought some chocalate bars and sweets to eat outside. We ate in the sun, looking over the country garden, before heading down there. It had very familiar vibes, and I saw a lot of what I'd expect to see at Kew or the Eden Project as well as some common English garden staples. It had a little cottage which we could poke our heads into. It was absolutely surreal, but it was also time to be moving along.</p>
                            <p>We still had a few souvenirs to buy so we headed to Mega Don Quixote again, knowing it would probably be our last major shopping trip so we had to get absolutely everying. We brought a whole load of souvenirs and snacks for the UK, as well as some matcha and other bits. We'd covered all of our bases, but we were sad to leave this most bizarre of supermarkets - like everything else in this place, we wouldn't get anything like it back home. I was starting to feel that end-of-holiday gloom, knowing that we had less than forty-eight hours left in Japa. But we had to fill the time as best we could.</p>
                            <p>It was late afternoon, so it was time to go to our last major Sapporo highlight - Mount Moiwa, a major mountain overlooking the Sapporo skyline with a state of the art viewing platform. We got a bus up to the funicular stuation. Because it was still early, we were able to get to the top without too much hassle, and as we got to the platform the whole city stretched out in front of us. Sapporo is an impressively large city and stretched back extremely far. It was impressively lit up, and I could see the neon haze rising up. It wasn't the tallest city, taller tha Paris but nowhere near as tall as Tokyo. It was an awesome sight, both on the side that faced the main city and the other, which faced the surrounding hills. At first, the crowds were spread out, but as the sun got close to setting over the city, they all crowded onto the eastern side. We had a couple of jumpers in our bag, knowing it would get cold, and we realised we needed to put them on straight away. </p>
                            <p>There were a few clouds in the sky but the sunset was glorious all the same. But as dusk set in it started to turn cold. We stood out there watching as the lights of Sapporo came on one by one. We alternated for a while, between the deck and the inside bit downstairs, which had a cafe and a shop - only the latter was open. We went down here when the cold got too hard to take before heading back up.</p>
                            <p>By the time we decided to make our way back, it was below freezing and the platform was absolutely jam packed with people. It was so busy that it took us aroud an hour to get down to the funicular station the queues were so bad. They were offering a free minibus service to the tram stop (of course they were; it's not England) so we got a tram into town for our very last stop - Susukino, Sapporo's entertainment central. It's utterly bizarre for the north island, just like Sapporo itself. A neon spectacle almost the equal of Akihabara or Dotonbori. We stopped at a place called the 500 Yen bar, first hejading straight in to find a seat then being remonstrated by a stern waitress who told us we had to wait at the door. We waited then headed in, drinking for cheap and ordering popcorn chicken which was delicious.</p>
                            <p>It was late so we headed back, doing our last minute packing of our now-properly bulging suitcases. We showered and slept, ready to go back to Tokyo for the final stretch.</p>

                            <p>We woke to our last proper day, not ready to say goodbye to Japan. We woke up early, our flight at 10am. We got there in good time and like before, the flight was seamless. We landed at 11:45 at Narita. In less than twenty four hours we'd be on the complete other side of Toyko at Haneda, but before that, we had one major location to check out: Shinjuku, and more specifically the neon metropolis of Kabukicho. Kabukicho is the party capital of Tokyo, a whole area decked out with more neon than anywhere else. It's littered with bars, restaurants, nightclubs, karaoke bars, and arcades. We'd be heading to Shinjuku soon, and our hotel was there as well. We got the subway into Shinjuku, and the neon hit us as soon as we arrived. It was everywhere, the buildings glowing even in broad daylight. We walked through immensely-packed streets towards our hotel, which was in a large courtyard with food trucks below.</p>
                            <p>The hotel lobby looked amazingly plush, which was strange because we'd had this marked this down as a budget option. It was all polished amber floor stones and granite columns, very sleek. We had high hopes based on that - that would eventually be dashed by the room but that's by the by - but we had to drop our bags off for now and head out as it was before checkin time.</p>
                            <p>We first decided to hit off another place that everyone goes to - Roppongi Hills. Roppongi is the richest part of Tokyo. It's geared towards wealthy tourists, but we decided to head there anyway as it's known for its culture. We went to a big shopping centre that was formed out of smooth stone. It looked incredibly classy but it was outside of our price range, plus it was an absolute labrynth. We ended up just getting a coffee from Starbucks and calling it a day, drinking it in the sleek outdoor seating area. I got another pang of "Oh no, we're going home" as I went to put the coffees in the bin. It's not because we had any speciifc attachment to Roppongi, I think it was more the end of being able to relax and enjoy a cup of coffee during the day instead of working.</p>
                            <p>It was back to Kabukicho for us to enjoy our last few hours in Japan. We started off with the one thing we knew would be the hardest to miss when we got back - sushi. We went to a conveyor belt place and ate our absolute fill, focusing on salmon and tuna sashimi. It was delicious and we had a proper meal out of it before heading out to the arcades. We started off at the proper arcade games, focusing on the rhythm games like drumming, guitar and Dance Dance Revolution. Then we went to do the claw machines, during which I managed to bag of donuts that were going to be for the plane but ended up being for the cupboard at home. </p>
                            <p>It was time to experience that famous Kamurocho nightlife. We stopped off in a place that had all you can drink - but this time, we were going do to it for an hour, and we were going to do it the Japanese way and not the English way and be sensible. I drank Asahi and Steph drank margaritas. We got served this strange unknown dish along with it but it didn't taste very good. Leaving them out of necessity was a breach of etiquette but we said we were full and reciprocated the friendliness of the waitress, so all was well, plus we ordered edamame beans and fried dumplings which were delicious, so we just made like we were full. The place had an automatic beer pouring-machine that tipped the glass and started to pour, leaving a perfect head.</p>
                            <p>We had a brief break that involved a quick trip back to the hotel now checkin was open. We brought our bags up and found a room that was painfully small and a bit musty, not to mention that had very poor noise insulation and picked up all the thumping music from the street. At the same time it had a great view of the street, and when we finally turned in I looked forward to looking out onto the ants below.</p>
                            <p>We headed back out, heading to a bar nearby and ordering a couple of beers. We got chatting to a couple of international students, one from Korea one from Sweden, though the beers were very expensive so we only had one before heading out and exploring further. Kamurocho had something that I hadn't seen anywhere else in Tokyo, or the rest of Japan for that matter: Dirt. The streets were dirty and grimy and there was rubbish piled up. There were also an absolute legion of drunk westerners unperturbed by the fact that it had just started raining.</p>
                            <p>We didn't have too much time left; we had a 4am alarm, but we had to do one thing again - head to a Big Echo. We went for an hour, and it was much more expensive - and impersonal - than the one down in Ginza. My voice was much better than the last time we'd sung back in that empty Shinjuku bar. That felt like an absolute age ago, but I also found myself thinking back even further, back to that first night, to the exact moment that we'd stood looking out from that overpass right near our hotel, feeling that a whole adventure, and a whole country, was open to us. I would have given anything to reset to that point.</p>
                            <p>It felt fair and not-too-indulgent to get slightly sad, seeing as we had no actual holiday left - our only steps of the journey left would be sleep, then a dull ride to the airport, then the journey home. It was pouring with rain during our journey back, and we walked quickly, getting in and showering. I did watch out of the window for a little while, seeing the people as they ran soaked from bar to club to bar. We set our 4am alarm, got packed, and turned in.</p>

                            <p>We woke up at four, dragging ourselves forcefully out of bed and downstairs, annoyed to find out it was still raining. Another thing that was still going on, to our amazement, was the party atmosphere. Kabukicho was no less busy than when we'd turned in, and that was after what looked like a whole night of heavy rain. People were out on the street, drunkenly having fun, and I saw others dressed extravagantly presumably having been on the way back from some glitzy club. It's a surreal experience, but we didn't have long to enjoy it. We got the train to Haneda, and our spirits - by then in the dumps despite barely being awake - were lifted slightly by the presence of an airport lounge. It was much smaller than Shanghai and had mostly pastries, including a big stack of macarons. I got my absolute fill of these while Steph ate healthier, but we still drank. Not everyone was given the early hour, but it was our last little smidgen of holiday and we'd be travelling for an insane amount of time.</p>
                            <p>We kept the lounge journey going in Shanghai; it was a slightly different one than we'd been to, and a lot busier. We ate more Chinese food and had more drinks, getting ourselves ready for a long flight.</p>
                            <p>The Shanghai to Heathrow flight was slightly longer than the Gatwick to Shanghai, but it felt much longer, particularly as we were headed home and were quite sad. I remember getting seriously stir crazy in the last four hours of the flight, spurred by the fact that I couldn't sleep and the in-flight selection was terrible. By the time we landed I was just itching to get off the plane, and Steph was the same.</p>
                            <p>It was a long, unhappy journey back from Heathrow, made worse by being instantly reminded that all the rules that made Japan a great place to travel in didn't apply here, and that Londoners - like everyone else in this country - are uneducated, ignorant and rude. We got in about seven in the evening, tired and ready for bed.</p>
                            <p>Japan is one hundred percent on the list to return. Next time we would do lots more of it in a road trip around the less-travelled parts, maybe more of the west coast. We miss it a lot. We haven't done what we've said we'll do, which is get massively into Japanese movies and shows, particularly anime and - for me, anyway - the films of Akira Kurosawa. But we will, and we have plenty of Japanese culture in available distance to tide us over until we go back.</p>
                            <p>And we definitely will.</p>
