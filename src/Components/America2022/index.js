                <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>It wasn’t long after our first glorious road trip to America that I started to think about a follow up. It started as a way to stave off the post-holiday blues, then a way to pass the time. At one point, I’d sketched out around fifteen different routes all around the US, and Canada at one point, but it all seemed like a wonderful pipe dream.</p>
                    <img src={Day1Pic1} alt="Day 1 Pic 1" className="landscapePictures" />
                    <p>It was COVID that served as the real impetus of our choice to go to America once again. We’d had some UK holidays in 2021 and 2020, Salisbury and Scotland respectively, and we did end up going to Athens in June. But like a lot of people coming out of lockdown, we had two things: a bit of extra money after months of minimal spending, and an absolutely burning desire to get out of the country. We had a few different choices; we both had an interest in seeing more of Asia, and I had some interest in going interrailing, albeit at hotels rather than dirty hostels.</p>
                    <p>But after two years of confinement and isolation, we knew that when we did do our next main holiday, it had to be REALLY big. Nothing but a major trip would suffice, and only a few destinations would count. At first, America again seemed an impossibility – for one I didn’t drive, I of course had no intention of saddling Steph with two weeks of shouldering the load, and we’d only been three years ago. Eventually I agreed, with the caveat that we make it clear to everyone that asks that this was Steph’s idea, and that I hadn’t demanded she be my chauffeur for a whole holiday.</p>
                    <p>Once our attention had turned to the US, discussions nationally turned to where we could go. The two of us pored over my previous routes and some others, but we underestimated one thing – how expensive it would be to go on a multi-airport journey in the financially-difficult world of post-COVID. While a circular journey around southern California worked perfectly last time, the routes I’d been looking at for this trip had been linear – a single journey across multiple states, each point in the journey well-defined – which didn’t work once we found out how expensive it was to travel back from different, and especially regional, airports. By the time it came to looking at flights, there was one state that formed the bulk of our looking, for our return flights as opposed to our outgoing: Montana.</p>
                    <p>For all the states that we were looking at, Montana featured very highly. Some had been easy eliminations; we had no major inclination, for example, to drive through thousands of miles of cornfields in Indiana, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois or Ohio. Others, such as East Coast (especially New England) were much more of a sell for me than Steph. But of all the western states, Montana figured as an absolute high on all relevant searches. It had the mountains, National Parks, and huge swathes of beautiful, barely-crossed wilderness.</p>
                    <p>The route we eventually settled on was, possibly ironically, not on my original list. We agreed we both wanted to do Vegas again, but beyond that, we were wide open. We initially thought of Montana as the end destination, maybe flying from one of its regional airports – probably Butte – to Chicago and then to London. It was on a very brief googling of prices that we found the flaw in this plan – it was a couple grand over the direct flights we’d looked at. We then had a slightly mad idea – what if we did direct flights to and from Vegas, but went to Montana too?</p>
                    <p>It wasn’t long before we found a clear solution – we would use Vegas as our flight base, but take a singular journey to the very top of Montana, to Glacier National Park right on the Canadian border, then drive back to Vegas. We initially had a very packed two-week concept, which I’m happy to say we changed into a much more expansive three-week holiday. There was just one more thing to add – and it was quite important.</p>
                    <p>We’d gotten engaged three years ago in the very same country, notwithstanding the very same part of the country, that we were going to now. Since then we’d come back and forth on the shape our wedding would take – me wanting something bigger and grander, Steph wanting something small and functional. With it being confirmed that we were going back to Vegas, Steph had what would turn out to be an incredible idea – we elope with a Las Vegas wedding! Moreover, we looked it up and there’s no problem with taking a Las Vegas marriage certificate to the UK – there’s no additional administration to make your wedding ‘valid’ in the UK. These were side considerations though; what really attracted Vegas, first to Steph and then to me, was the unique and romantic attraction to the spiritual home of eloping, not a hundred miles from where we got engaged. We booked the Graceland Chapel, where David Harbour and Lily Allen, plus a bunch of other celebrities, got married. And as everything got gradually booked, our excitement reached fever pitch.</p>

                    <div className="days" id="day1">
                        <p>We were all set.</p>
                        <p>After weeks of waiting, we were ready to fly to America. We’d booked flights, hotels, spent hours looking at things to do, and – especially in the last couple of weeks – compiled a gigantic playlist for the road.</p>  
                        <p>We were fascinated by how our flight would turn out. We hadn’t flown long-haul since just before COVID, and while we’d flown in June, we knew that the difference between Virgin and Wizz Air would be the difference between driving a Ferrari and an old Vauxhall Corsa that had failed its MOT.</p>
                        <p>We were leaving the house in John and Michele’s very capable hands for three weeks while they used it as a base, and Michele drove us to the airport to boot. We packed exceptionally well thanks to the vacuum bags Steph had bought. We had a slight hiccup – Steph didn’t think she needed to bring her driving licence – but thanks to her diligent driving Michele got us to the airport in excellent time.</p>
                        <p>Things were slightly different to the last time we flew with Virgin. Firstly, the food had dropped off. Secondly, the huge selection of films we’d been given last time, from brand-new movies to a big array of classics, was gone, replaced by a small, forgettable selection. And finally, their free-flowing booze was gone, replaced by stingy timed services that was apparently in aid of responsible drinking but we all knew was about post-COVID cost-cutting.</p>
                        <p>But we didn’t care. We were so excited that the flight went by quite quickly, and before long we were touching down in Las Vegas on a beautifully sunny afternoon. Last time we arrived in San Fran, we’d had a huge wait in arrivals, but this time we got through quickly and painlessly. Then we got outside.</p>
                        <p>There is simply nothing in the world like desert heat, and it hit us the moment we got out of the air conditioned arrivals lounge. In the months leading up to our flight, the UK had been hit by successive heat waves, but heat waves in southern England are humid, sticky things that make your clothes cling to you and force you to sleep in a damp blanket of your own sweat. Desert heat? That couldn’t be more different. It’s a dry, dusty heat that makes you feel like you’re under a giant tanning bulb. You can’t bear it for long, much as you can’t bear a humid heatwave, but it feels amazing the first time it hits you.</p>
                        <p>We had one important stop to make before we got to the hotel: the Clark County Marriage Licence Bureau, where we’d pick up the marriage licence that would be validated at our ceremony tomorrow. I had a fantastical image of how it might be – young kids in their early twenties running from patriarchal families and ready to start their lives together, like Rod Stewart’s Young Turks. It wasn’t that at all. It was an almost even mix of people not too dissimilar to us, having a Vegas wedding as a quirky alternative to a traditional ceremony, and people who I don’t feel any hesitation to call trash.</p>
                        <p>The Bureau gave me a sharp reminder that COVID had taken away my street-smarts, which I feel is a statement that needs explanation. There were several people looking semi-official outside the marriage licence bureau and normally I’d have immediately sussed that they were looking for something. COVID, however, had given me one instinct when dealing with government facilities, specifically testing and vaccine centres – don’t do anything until you find the person who looks helpful and they’ll tell you what to do. So I was in full engagement with the people standing outside the bureau as opposed to smiling without making particular eye contact, nodding, and walking past. They actually did direct me inside, and didn’t directly ask for and demand tips, though they were of course full of recommendations about where to get married.</p>
                        <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>We picked up our marriage certificate, the drab bureaucratic settings doing nothing to stifle our excitement. We got out and got a cab straight to the Luxor to check in. It was one of those casinos that we’d always seen from afar, but neither of us had been inside. It was an especially cool structure both outside and inside, and we were already itching for a shower and a change of clothes. We had one hitch – the tower where we’d reserved was fully booked so we needed to stay in the main pyramid. We kicked up a polite stink and got our resort fees comped, as well as fifty dollars on our room account!</p>
                        <img src={Day1Pic2} alt="Day 1 Pic 2" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>The room was just fine, very modern with a very nice bathroom. We both showered and got our wedding clothes ready for tomorrow. The next stop was food. We’d be having some incredible meals on our holiday, but our first dinner didn’t quite count – I went to a little convenience store within the casino and bought two cold subs, which we ate unceremoniously in the room. It was around nine in the evening at this point, and Steph was ready for bed – though I wanted to check out the casino. Steph gave me the option of going down alone, and while I thought about it, bed was calling just as much.</p>

                        <p>While I may have kicked and screamed slightly about eloping, I have to admit there’s something magical about waking up on your wedding day in Las Vegas. In a few hours we’d be married, a small delay in paperwork aside, ready to enjoy our holiday as husband and wife.</p>
                        <p>We got a big, delicious breakfast in the Pyramid Café, the Luxor’s in-house diner. Steph had a breakfast BLT and I had their equivalent of a Full English. We were glad to find a proper sit-down meal after last night’s cold subs, and we needed to steel our stomachs – otherwise we’d eat later and ruin our very special wedding night dinner.</p>
                        <p>It took us a while to get ready before we got dressed to the nines. Steph looked so beautiful in her wedding dress, and I readily admit I scrubbed up pretty good. We were full of excitement as we waited for 1pm, where we’d be picked up by a fancy limousine and taken to our wedding.</p>
                        <img src={Day2Pic2} alt="Day 2 Pic 2" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>We had some confusion finding the limo, but it did show on time, and was impressive! We felt like VIPs getting chauffeured over to the Graceland Chapel in this thing, making our way through traffic and no doubt making everyone feel just that little bit jealous. The place was quite far off the strip and down a side road, but was very pretty – it was the opposite of the kind of place I’d been reverse-pitching while arguing against eloping - a dreary little place without anything resembling romance. This place was a nice, pleasant little building that was a welcome touch of something almost small-town among the towers of Vegas.</p>
                        <p>We saw some of the other people who’d been married at Graceland, and saw one pair of familiar faces – David Harbour and Lily Allen! We got all booked in and went inside the chapel to meet our photographer and our minister. True to its name, Graceland’s main minister is an Elvis impersonator, so you can get married by Elvis. The vast majority of people have taken this option, but neither of us are Elvis fans, so we opted for another minister thinking he – or she – would be more of an elegant option.</p>
                        <p>The guy was…unusual. He was French, an older man, and very eccentric. He’d go on long, rambling diatribes about marriage, the bible and sex, all of which he’d punctuate with an utterly creepy Yeessss. He reminded me of the arms dealer from In Bruges, which is normally a reference I’d be all for, but he just weirded us out. The minister wasn’t the only hitch – my boutonnière, fixed in by the lady at the front desk only minutes ago, fell out right as Steph was walking down the aisle, sending me scrambling to get it at the worst possible moment! At first I was mortified, but then came to appreciate that it made the whole thing so uniquely us.</p>
                        <p>We didn’t get prompted for our wedding song (which we hadn’t chosen anyway) but we did get prompted for our vows – which we had prepared. I’d drafted mine in the few weeks before we flew and got a final draft around two weeks before – but Steph’s was more of a collection of ideas. I helped her refine it on the plane, fleshed it out more and gave her a signature touch – Soupsnakes from The Office! I’ve kept these vows for posterity at the end of this journal, so go check it out.</p>
                        <p>The whole ceremony went through too fast, even with the weird minister’s psychedelic ravings slowing things down, and soon – pending the latter receipt of the marriage certificate – we were married! We were going to spend the rest of our lives together as man and wife, and we’d had an experience we’d never forget into the bargain.</p>
                        <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>Once the ceremony was over, we needed to celebrate! We had a reservation booked at an extremely swanky steakhouse – STK – later, but we were in the mood for champagne, and we’d heard excellent things about Freemont Street, Vegas’s famous downtown where the locals enjoy themselves without the inflated prices of the strip. We stopped off in a random hotel bar for champagne first while the fanfare came in from the folks who had been watching it through Facebook. The place wasn’t great for more than a couple of glasses though – so we headed slightly down the road and went to a place we’d looked up – the exclusive Legacy Club.</p>
                        <img src={Day2Pic3} alt="Day 2 Pic 3" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>The Legacy Club was a cut above much of Vegas in terms of class. It conjured up connotations of the very peak of fifties elegance, a glamorous cocktail bar with an equally-glamorous patio terrace commanding impressive views of outer Vegas. We ordered two very expensive cocktails – a Sazerac for me and some delicious concoction for Steph – as soon as they opened at four in the afternoon. We had the whole place to ourselves, even when we left – which we did after our first drink.</p>
                        <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>We took a cab over to STK, hungry and ready to fill our bellies. Steph had warned me this place was expensive, but my stomach lurched when I saw the menu. This would be the most expensive meal we’d have on this holiday, and probably in our lives, but while I was slightly anxious at the time, I soon calmed down and enjoyed our food. We had some excellent champagne and started out with a mouth-watering platter of lobster, prawn, and a variety of mixed shellfish on a bed of ice, alongside butter sauce and other accompaniments. Our steaks were delicious, perfectly cooked, and I learned a valuable lesson about etiquette in upscale dining – you’re not supposed to help the waiters with anything or do anything for yourself. You don’t pour champagne, you don’t hand over dishes, you are simply there to be waited on.</p>
                        <img src={Day2Pic4} alt="Day 2 Pic 4" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>We walked back to the Luxor, wanting to take in the city like we’d done before. Vegas isn’t the easiest city to walk through – you can’t just walk down the block, you have to navigate an endless series of walkways and promenades, and it takes twice as long as any other city. In London, with open streets and no jaywalking laws, I can get across town in no time at all, and I could have walked from London Bridge to Victoria in the forty or so minutes it took us to walk just over a mile back. But that’s no problem at all; Vegas is a lovely city to walk around in, and I’m reminded of a singular moment that wonderfully soundtracked us as we walked – a busker singing Creedence Clearwater’s <i>Have you ever seen the Rain?</i></p>
                        <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>It was by all counts an amazing wedding day. We’d each found our soulmate and the person who we wanted to spend the rest of our lives with - and now we had an amazing adventure to look forward to!</p>

                        <p>Day 3 was important for two main reasons. Firstly, it was our last day in Las Vegas – tomorrow we’d be setting off on a long journey to Salt Lake City. But secondly, we were going to be doing something I’d looked forward to for the longest time – shooting guns! Back in California 2019, I’d been looking for a decent gun rental place, but I hadn’t gotten round to it. This time, Steph had very kindly booked a shooting experience for my birthday present, and we’d shortly be taking a ride in a military Humvee to an awesome shooting experience by a company called Battlefield Vegas.</p>
                        <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>I wanted to ride on the back of the Humvee when it arrived, which would prove scarier than I thought. With the heavy camo decals on the vehicle and the desert surroundings, I really felt like we were driving through downtown Baghdad as a two-person platoon. It was boiling hot by the time we got out into the open and I’d slathered factor 50 all over myself, terrified of having my usual reaction to too much sunburn too early in the holiday.</p>
                        <img src={Day3Pic1} alt="Day 3 Pic 1" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>Battlefield Vegas wasn’t just a shooting range; it had an absolutely impressive array of decommissioned military machinery, from Apache helicopters to Sherman tanks. You could ride each one (I mean a static ride of course, we couldn’t take them on manoeuvres) and we got some great photos from various cockpits.</p>
                        <img src={Day3Pic2} alt="Day 3 Pic 2" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>Once we were done marvelling at the equipment, we went inside. The place had an impressive collection of guns of every time, from Civil War-era Winchester rifles to P90s, that assault rifle that looks like it’s from the future. We checked out the shop while we waited to get called in. I saw lots of what I’d call casual right-wing indicators, which are a lot more prevalent in the US than the UK – most of it Second Amendment, such as diatribes against gun control. It wasn’t over the top, but gun culture doesn’t attract an overly liberal breed of people.</p>
                        <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>It was time for us to shoot. Our instructor was Alan, a former squaddie who’d done tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was a nice guy, and professional, and like me, had nothing but disdain for wealthy Saudis. That sounds especially random, but it came from him explaining to us at length about some of the rows he’d had with Saudi clients who didn’t like him touching their wives while teaching them to shoot. We easily fell into the category of ‘Europeans who I normally associate as anti-gun hyperliberals but are actually very interested in guns and are keen to shoot’ for him, so I think he liked us.</p>
                        <img src={Day3Pic3} alt="Day 3 Pic 3" className="portraitPictures" />
                        <p>After we were done, we took another Humvee ride to the Sahara, where we’d stayed back in 2019, back when it had been temporarily renamed SLS. It wasn’t nostalgia that brought us back through – the place had been a fairly common point of retreat last time when we wandered into a casino with high table minimums, as around half of the casino had five dollar minimum bets. This was important – the little bit of gambling we’d done so far had revealed a slightly disheartening pattern; Vegas was out to bleed us dry. The table minimums, whether in roulette or blackjack – they were always slightly higher in Blackjack but could go down as low as three or four dollars on the roulette – had jumped to fifteen dollars minimum, with many a lot higher.</p>
                        <p>It made sense from a business point of view. The big casinos must have come close to going broke during the pandemic, and if someone had already signed on to spend more than a day or so in the city, it was a given that they’d still play some hands even if they had to dip further into their bank balances to pay for it. But I can say that, in addition to the amount of times we’d been to the city already, was the reason we decided we wouldn’t come back to Vegas.</p>
                        <p>The Sahara was a bust. Table minimums were just as high here, and while some people had decided to just bite the bullet and start gambling, we decided to leave it until later. We were hungry, and we had a close eye on a McDonalds we’d been to around the corner last time. The walk over was a lot more intimidating than we remembered; we’d seen lots of homeless and junkies around here last time, but this time they were on the move. I didn’t feel directly threatened, it was broad daylight after all, but some of the faces we passed looked like they were one bout of withdrawal symptoms away from mugging you for a score. It was only a short walk away though, and we enjoyed a hearty meal before deciding to get an Uber back to the Luxor for a leisurely go on the much-cheaper video roulette machines, as well as to have a swim.</p>
                        <p>I’d never been more glad that we had arrived at the end of the US school holidays as opposed to earlier in the summer. The swimming pool was crowded by an unseemly blend of young kids and their parents, and party groups in their twenties sunning themselves and playing ball games. The vibe was completely off, and we got semi-told off by a member of staff due to us moving our sunbeds close to the poolside where it was shady.</p>
                        <p>We didn’t stay long. We got dressed, hung around on the video roulette, while we waited for the evening. We had tickets to see the Blue Man Group, who were in residence at this very hotel, and we were both excited. Our original plan had been the Jew Man Group, a piggyback gimmick with comedy in place of a visual show, and while we would eventually see them on our return trip to Vegas, we’d managed to grab the actual main event. We won some money, having a couple of drinks – spaced out by the fact that three and four dollar tips to the waitresses didn’t quite cut it anymore – before heading to Fat Tuesdays. Fat Tuesdays is an alcoholic slushie popup that has popular cocktail flavours like Margarita and Pina Colada. We got our slushies in a sports bottle which we could later return to fill for a discount, and we kept these two all through our trip, establishing them to be handy water bottles on the road.</p>
                        <p>The evening was drawing on and it was time to head to the Blue Man Group. It was a psychedelic setup with lots of atmospheric lights before the show started. The auditorium was smaller than I imagined with how big their own individual building looked compared to the Luxor, but we got good seats and were on time. Which was lucky – they highlight latecomers pretty hard.</p>
                        <p>I’d had an inkling that I wouldn’t like the show in advance, and I’d thrown up a few lightweight objections when we’d made the decision to book. I don’t particularly like visual comedy, and the snippet I see of what a typical BMG performance looks like – lots of synchronised instruments – didn’t seem like it would get my interest. Of course, Penn and Teller are quite visual, as befits magicians, but I had two things on my side there – one, I’d liked their magic on and off for quite some time, and two, I’d recently had a colleague sing their praises to me before we decided to book.</p>
                        <p>So when their set got going and I found myself a bit underwhelmed, I kept it to myself for a while. They were all style and no substance, and I couldn’t have cared less for the manner of their style. It was lots of quirky moves and showing off, and I cared neither for the showboating nor for the music they were making. Shortly after I discovered something – Steph wasn’t enjoying it either! We were both quite bored, wishing we’d spent our last night in Vegas doing something else. What really put the final nail in the coffin was an utterly grotesque act which included an audience member – the only bit of audience participation I’d ever outright refuse to do if asked – and it involved some weird-smelling putty they ‘ate’ as Chinese food from the box, then vomited grossly outward, then scooped back up and ate again. Vomit stuff turns my stomach at the best of times, and I was completely repulsed by this. I don’t have a weak stomach when it comes to most things, especially horror, but nausea-fuel is a particular weakness of mine. The display ruined my appetite, and even though I would have otherwise been quite hungry afterwards, I couldn’t even think about eating, and the last thing in my stomach that day had been the McDonalds lunch.</p>
                        <p>We stayed to the end but perched ourselves right near the exit, and headed out as soon as they finished. I understand that people enjoy the Blue Man Group and for lots of people it’s a once-in-a-lifetime show, but we both found it underwhelming. We didn’t dwell on it for too long though we were too excited. Tomorrow morning we’d be picking up our rental car and hitting the open road. Our first day would be a long journey to Salt Lake City, our essential conduit for the steady trip north, and we were both very excited about hitting the open road, with a touch of nervousness on Steph’s part as it was the first time in three years she’d driven in the States. She’d done an amazing job in Scotland last year, but nerves were understandable. We’d be back to Vegas at the end of the journey, a thought I had absolutely no intention of allowing into my head.</p>
                        <p>We fought through the excitement and managed to get a solid night’s sleep for the journey tomorrow.</p>

                        <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>We woke up nice and early the next morning and got ourselves packed, washed, and ready. We had time to kill, so went down to the video roulette again with our suitcases perched near us. We picked up the car from the valet parking at ten in the morning – it was a white Nissan Versa which seemed in quite good nick, despite some paint that had worn away around the tires. We took pictures of every square inch of the car before we loaded it up, and Steph took it onto the I-15, that gigantic highway that stretches all the way from the Mexican to the Canadian border.</p>
                        <img src={Day4Pic2} alt="Day 4 Pic 2" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>Steph regained her confidence naturally following a few moments of uncertainty, very much in the same frame of mind she’d had when driving around Cali. I was adjusting slightly worse to the car, however; the air-con wasn’t very strong, the sun was beaming down on my side, and the car became a hotbox quite quickly. It was unbearable at first, and I was probably unbearable for it, but soon I got used to it and was able to stay cool.</p>
                        <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>The Fifteen took us through untold deserts on our journey to the border of Utah. When we’d first arrived in the Mojave, I’d come to the same conclusion as last time; it was less a sandy, featureless landscape like the Sahara, and more a rocky, stony shrubland like the Jornada del Muerto or the Sonoran over in Cali. Going northeast, however, I could tell I was wrong. The desert on either side of the highway was sandy, and very red in many parts. It was a beautiful sight after spending three days in the big city.</p>
                        <img src={Day4Pic3} alt="Day 4 Pic 3" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>We saw a lot of what I recognised as Vegas’s satellite towns on the way. These are quite a random sight. They spring up everywhere as more and more casino and city staff get hired, and are known for being quite dead places with no culture of their own; no bars, no restaurants, no arts, just a few rows of brand-new houses that looked like scaled-down McMansions. I’m aware that description could apply to lots of suburb towns orbiting big cities, but I feel as if these places make special effort not to bother to make those towns entertaining when the world capital of entertainment is nearby.</p>
                        <img src={Day4Pic4} alt="Day 4 Pic 4" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>It wasn’t too long before we were approaching the Utah border. Each state really wants you to know that you’re going there, and I made sport of snapping photographs of each state line sign as I went. I didn’t get everything on the trip sadly, but I was glad to start our journey off on the right foot.</p>
                        <img src={Day4Pic5} alt="Day 4 Pic 5" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>Utah didn’t transform our scenery immediately, to Steph’s minor disappointment. We were still driving through a similar desert. I said that they don’t design state barriers around changes in landscape, but it would have been quite cool to see an immediate change. It wasn’t too long before the desert started to shift though. The sand was lighter, there was more vegetation, and it didn’t take us long to realise that we’d shifted an hour ahead. I said to Steph later in the evening that when we crossed the state line, we changed both time and religion; we were now in Mormon country.</p>
                        <p>We stopped at the midway point, a tiny little town in southwest Utah called Beaver. It had a couple of small streets, a gas station (which I’ll generally call it for the rest of this account even though it is really a petrol garage) and a little Mexican restaurant. It was a rinky-dink little place, tiled in a way that reminded me of my old school toilets, but with a friendly older lady running it. I ordered hard tacos, not realising I was actually ordering taquitos, a similar dish with a thick outer shell, and Steph got Chimichangas. The portions were gigantic, and it’s a rare day where I don’t finish my food, but I ended up taking quite a few of the taquitos with me.</p>
                        <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>We topped up gas, which due to the international restrictions of our Revolut card we came to develop a system for – I’d go into the station shop first, top up a preset amount, then come back and start scrubbing at the front of the car while Steph pumped gas. The amount of insects that get smashed on your car when driving out west is insane – it hadn’t been so bad in California, but out here in Utah, our bonnet was a Jackson Pollock of colourful insect splats. I always got slightly grossed out by this task, but I quite liked topping up gas; I liked seeing the range of reactions the cashiers got to an English guy. Sometimes they’d be completely nonplussed, sometimes they’d be surprised or confused but took pains not to show it, other times they leaned right into it and would ask where I was from. They were generally good for a chat or possibly a banter, in the type of banter Americans are good at, without the inherent meanness of British bants.</p>
                        <img src={Day4Pic6} alt="Day 4 Pic 6" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>There were bigger and bigger towns on the approach to Salt Lake City, but as soon as we got nearby, the big towns in the area – Provo, West Valley City, Jordan, Bluffdale, American Fork – blended together to form one continuous metropolitan area that stretched all the way to SLC. They were bisected quite sharply by the Fifteen, which especially when it came to Provo looked like it had been steamrolled right through the centre of town. I’d heard about Provo – it tops the charts as the happiest city in the United States, and while I’d found it difficult to drill down why, it was originally one of my stops. Though seeing it in action, I doubted I’d missed much.</p>
                        <p>Salt Lake City was a very different beast to the cities we’d seen so far. As far as big cities are concerned, I’ve been to Vegas, LA, San Francisco, Portland and Seattle, and every single one of them had a USP. Gambling for Vegas, Hollywood for LA, the Bay for San Francisco, Portland’s whole entire beatnik vibe, and green spaces and music for Seattle. Salt Lake City had no distinctive USP. You might say that the Latter Day Saints are the USP, but that’s only a small part of the city centre; the rest of the place is nondescript.</p>
                        <img src={Day4Pic1} alt="Day 4 Pic 1" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>We found our hotel for the next two nights, the Ramada. After the relative luxury of the Luxor, it was quite a big let-down. It was a very low-level corporate type of motel, the kind of place that the less-successful travelling salesmen stay while on business in the city. But the room was okayish, nice and spacious, and we weren’t too far from the centre of town.</p>
                        <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>We showered and changed and got ready to head out for the evening. I wanted to check out Temple Square, the headquarters of the LDS, where there was a museum that taught all about church history. I knew that the Mormons had had an interesting history; being kicked from pillar to post by the government and angry locals, all the way from the east to Utah, they’d actually fought wars against the US army before, and were fiercely independent. We arrived a little late, and couldn’t find the place, so we headed out of the parking and had a walk around town.</p>
                        <img src={Day4Pic7} alt="Day 4 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>The place reminded me very much of a city from the late 1900s, with its antique trams, broad streets, and lots of gothic and art deco buildings among the more modern constructions. It was clean and pretty, but we saw quite a few homeless around, grouped up in that same intimidating way we’d seen back in Vegas.</p>
                        <p>We wandered the streets, getting hungry, looking around for something to do. We stopped off at a souvenir shop and bought a few bits; we’d decided to get a fridge magnet for every state we stopped in, and we bought a few other bits besides. We got chatting to the clerk, who gave us a heads up about a spot to check out, Big Cottonwood. We then went to a bar and sat outside; it was quite busy and overpriced, but we got to do some great people-watching as we had a beer. We were quite hungry at this point, and having seen a few ramen places – Steph is a huge ramen fan – we set off to find one.</p>
                        <p>It was unfortunately futile – everywhere was either closed or had sold out of ramen. SLC is one of those early-evening cities where everything closes up around the nine PM mark. We gave up, got in the car, and went to In N’ Out burger for a takeaway, which we ate in our hotel room. Then, with a hell of a long journey behind us, we got some sleep. </p>

                        <p>Before we journeyed north tomorrow, we had a full day to spend around SLC. We were going to factor in Big Cottonwood as of yesterday’s recommendation, but one spot we both really wanted to go to was Antelope Island. This island – actually a peninsula – lies on the Great Salt Lake and is a fascinating wildlife refuge and hiking spot. We grabbed a quick breakfast at the hotel – a grab back with convenience-store pastries and a coffee – then drove over.</p>
                        <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>The Great Salt Lake is a strange and beautiful sight. It’s very light blue, aquamarine-coloured, and completely still. There are no waves, no ripples, no choppy waters. The only breaks from the perfectly-crystalline surface are the salt deposits near the shore, which form a sort of Aurora Borealis effect.</p>
                        <img src={Day5Pic1} alt="Day 5 Pic 1" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>We started our journey by heading over to the Buffalo Point trail, one of the island’s major short hiking trails, a light incline with some good views at the top. The last time we’d hiked had been Scotland, and Steph would be the first to admit it wasn’t her finest moment hiking – she was able to cope with the sharp incline of hikes such as the Old Man of Storr on Skye, but had to rest quite often. I had better general endurance at the time but my overall fitness was quite poor. This time, however, we were a relative fitness machine between the two of us – we’d been going to the gym for the last three months. As soon as we got onto the trail, Steph was a powerhouse, leading the way and breaking ahead. The trail was narrow but well-beaten, with long grass surrounding us on either side.</p>
                        <img src={Day5Pic2} alt="Day 5 Pic 2" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>I got nervous about the long grass. Antelope Island, like most of the southwest, was home to all sorts of breeds of spider, including – to my horror – my arachnid bête noire, the tarantula. As a result, I scanned every patch of grass and hedge, not to mention our path in case one of the hideous creatures crawled over it. I didn’t see any tarantulas – throughout the whole trip, thankfully – but I did see one very unusual spider that I’d never seen before – a strange, teal coloured one that even a committed arachnophobe can confirm looked quite interesting. </p>
                        <p>We got to the top in no time, Steph a bundle of fitness-based energy, and surveyed the view. We could see a large stretch of the Salt Lake ahead of us, pulling into the distance, with more of those strange salt formations going along with it. We took in the view properly and took a slow walk down the sloped path.</p>
                        <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>On our way to the ranch we saw buffalo. Actual, living buffalo right out of a western film. I’d seen them before, on a farm in Wiltshire (courtesy of a farmer with a big obsession with Native Americans) but seeing them here, right in their natural habitat, was something else entirely. There were dozens of them scattered among the sandy plains, formed into loose family units, with calves trailing their mothers as they lumbered and grazed.</p>
                        <img src={Day5Pic3} alt="Day 5 Pic 3" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>We would be fortunate enough to see lots of buffalo on our travels, but this group definitely left a big lasting impact on us. We drove on to the ranch, taking a walk over to the barn area first. It was a fantastic bit of living history, all tastefully cluttered with tools and equipment like saddles, anvils, and a whetstone. Lots of the display was interactive, including – to our childish delight - an old butter churn, which we were keen to try out.</p>
                        <img src={Day5Pic4} alt="Day 5 Pic 4" className="portraitPictures" />
                        <p>The ranch-house was slightly more Spartan than I’d thought. When you think of ranch houses, you think of profligate cattle-baron mansions, which is silly when you think that cattle-barons were only a tiny percentage of ranch owners, and that most of them weren’t that better off than their ranch hands.</p>
                        <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>It was a fascinating house, less cluttered than the barn but filled with all sorts of interesting details. What I really respected about the place was that they didn’t seal off its contents as if the public were wayward children that can’t be trusted with nice things. There wasn’t a ‘please don’t touch’ sign to be found, and I was able to peruse the house’s bookshelves at my leisure – I got way too invested in an early twentieth century etiquette guide for young well-to-do ladies and gentlemen, and I – much like all of the ranch’s visitors who must have thumbed through it and other volumes – treated it with the utmost respect. There’s a lesson there.</p>
                        <img src={Day5Pic5} alt="Day 5 Pic 5" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>The historians in charge of maintaining the place clearly had a slightly twisted sense of humour – there were dolls of varying and increasing creepiness scattered all over the place, particularly on the beds. Their glass eyes were still and lifeless but seemed to follow you all around the room for some reason. I’m sure we had at least one nightmare a piece about them.</p>
                        <p>We saw the bunkhouses that were shared by workers as well as the stables. The whole place was very impressive, a real piece of classic Americana. I struggled to see how anyone could set up a business in such intense heat, let alone an outdoorsy business like a cattle ranch, but the place would still have been a little slice of heaven to the ranchers living here – but probably not the ranch hands.</p>
                        <p>I had one major desire on Antelope Island – I wanted to swim in the Great Salt Lake if such a thing were possible. For the last major leg of our time on the island we drove over to Bridger Bay, one of Antelope’s major beach areas. If you’re picturing parasols and a beach bar, you’re way off the mark – it was a grassy, sandy desert with a snack bar that was little more than a large shack. </p>
                        <p>We parked up and set off walking to the lake. It was around half a mile to the water’s edge, which would have been a gentle stroll anywhere else, but across that tract of boiling white sand in 40 degree weather was like trekking the Sahara in a mankini. Shortly, we reached the water, and what I’d expected – beautifully cool water I could swim out into – was quite sharply subverted. There was a solid crust of pure salt granules, and as soon as I stepped out onto it, it gave way to hot salty mud below. My feet were quickly caked in that horrible stuff, and I retreated from the lake like it was the filthy Thames.</p>
                        <p>My dreams of swimming in the Great Salt Lake dashed, we decided on a tactical retreat. The walk back felt like torture despite being one of the shortest distances we’d traverse throughout our holiday. As my feet were slathered in mud, I didn’t put my shoes back on, leading to utter agony of the feet over sizzling white sand and salt. Eventually I gave up, putting a pair of socks – which I would later dump – over the mud and my hiking boots over my socks. With my boots on, the walk back was slightly more tolerable, but I was still running on empty by the time we got back.</p>
                        <p>That snack bar – a place called the Island Buffalo Grill – was an unbelievable godsend. It was a sparse place, with concrete floors and Soviet metal benches, but if there is one place in this world that has a greater understanding of the needs of its clients, I haven’t encountered it yet. What I mean by this is that they had ice water; real ice water, the kind that would give you hypothermia after a few gulps in any other climate. We had icy Gatorade too, and I had a snowcone, all of which were designed with maximum relief in mind.</p>
                        <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>We headed away from Antelope Island and back to the hotel so I could get myself cleaned up. We drove over to Big Cottonwood, the canyon that had been recommended by the gift shop guy. It was about an hour’s drive outside the city limits through mountain roads that could only be described as ‘Shining-esque’. Big Cottonwood is a popular ski resort, which was a surprise to me because I can’t imagine Utah being a major player in snowy sports. We stopped off at Silver Lake, a beautiful nature spot, which included a five-mile looped hike around the lake itself. We got chatting to some older folk out on the lake, one of whom was a Brit by birth, born in Southampton. I remember that because I followed it up with “I love Southampton” which is a darn dirty lie, considering that Southampton is a sleazy dockers’ town with a major chav infestation. His wife was curious about where Steph was from in a way that was too adorable to be considered racist by either of us.</p>
                        <img src={Day5Pic6} alt="Day 5 Pic 6" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>The hike was absolutely beautiful, and our new friend hadn’t steered us wrong. I couldn’t believe that a place like this could exist in a state that I assumed was mostly desert. There was a thick pine forest all around the lake and the whole thing was very tranquil. We saw deer in the distance, and most people didn’t get far enough around the hike to make things too crowded. Around two-thirds of the way through, one of the serious hikers directed us to a small diversion path where a moose and her calves could be seen. There were a small group of us observing as they grazed. The mother moose was gigantic; much like everything else in the American wilderness they can kill a fully-grown man with the minimum of effort, and that’s without even using their fearsome horns. That proved too much for some of the observers, who tried to get slightly closer, but for us I was just content to watch them do their thing. They’re absolutely incredible animals.</p>
                        <img src={Day5Pic7} alt="Day 5 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                        <p>After completing the loop of our hike, we drove back into central SLC. We saw our friend who’d recommended Big Cottonwood packing in some bits from outside his gift shop after a long shift, and he was delighted that we’d got so much out of it. We had one singular goal in mind – ramen. Steph was desperate to experience one of the ramen places we’d missed out on, and I was getting hungry. We found a quirky little place that served delicious ramen, and turned in reasonably early. We had another long drive tomorrow, just under five hours in total, going to the very north of Utah, through Idaho, and into Montana, with our final destination being the town of West Yellowstone, which would be our base as we ventured into the most famous national park in the US – Yellowstone.</p>

                        <h4 className="dayHeader">Day 6</h4>
                        <h5 className="dayLocation">West Yellowstone</h5>

                        <div>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>Having spent some time in the Pacific Northwest, I’d heard quite a bit about Idaho. On the other hand, it was described by all as an untapped, beautifully isolated wilderness, an Alaska of the Midwest. That was only one side of it, though. The progressives I’d spent my time with in Oregon had described the place as a haven for right-wing lunatics, and I also knew – both from a documentary I’d watched and an offhand joke in an episode of Frasier – that the state was full of extremist anti-government militias. A part of me was worried, considering that we were coming to the place as an interracial married couple, but another part of me wasn’t – I’d said coming to America that I’d love to actually talk to some right-wingers, especially Trump supporters, and see how they tick. Having been to some pretty rednecky places, chief of which was probably the town of Bridgeport back in California, and I still maintained the same thought – even racist rednecks don’t care anything about where you come from as long as you don’t act any different from them. This trip would prove this theory right for some people and wrong for others – but neither happened in Idaho.</p>
                            <img src={Day6Pic2} alt="Day 6 Pic 2" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>That’s not to say that the place was a bastion of tolerance; we saw lots of signs of the state’s support for Trump along the way (some of them quite literal) and I learned to my shock that Ammon Bundy, part of that infernal Bundy clan that fought the Bureau of Land Management and led an armed occupation of a federal wildlife refuge over in Washington, was running for governor and had signs out all over the place. But since he didn’t win, and since we saw worse Trump signs in Montana and Wyoming, I can’t quite declare it a Neo-Nazi stronghold.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>The state is as wild as described, though. You can drive hundreds of miles without passing so much as a tiny roadside town, and the wild mountains and forests stretch as far as the eye can see. If you were to wind up in one of those forests, it might be a good week’s worth of walking before you found the highway again. We did pass a few towns in our massive drive, though; Malad, Downey, Pocatello, and a few more. They were pleasant places, but we’d already scouted out our midway stopping point – a picturesque little town called Blackfoot.</p>
                            <img src={Day6Pic3} alt="Day 6 Pic 3" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>I’ve been to a good few little towns across the West Coast, some with Steph some without, and to this day I struggle to think of a nicer place than Blackfoot. It’s pulled right out of a picture book, or an Edward Hopper painting, or a Stephen King novel without the creeping sense of menace. Its Main Street has a quaint, historical feel to it, and it boasts one of the weirdest museums I’ve seen since a certain phallic one in Reykjavik – the Idaho Potato Museum. Idaho is one of the biggest potato growers in the world, and Blackfoot is known informally as the Potato Capital of the World. As a part Irishman, that was either going to pique me or pique my curiosity, but the place was positively-reviewed enough that I wouldn’t have wanted to miss it.</p>
                            <img src={Day6Pic4} alt="Day 6 Pic 4" className="portraitPictures" />
                            <p>The Idaho Potato Museum marks its presence with a huge sculpture of a jacket potato, which is a quirky example of what one could expect from the place. It’s run by one family, who both grow and cook potatoes near the town. The museum turned out to be a very thorough collection, with a well-researched history of potato growth in Idaho throughout the decades, from early cultivation, through to Idaho’s potato-based culture of the Twentieth Century. As an Aspie, I can thoroughly respect a bizarre devotion to a singular object of study, and if my family’s fortune had been made by the humble potato, I’d want to scream about it to the rafters too.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>After the museum, we went to get some food, going to an awesome barbecue place we’d spotted earlier. It was set in a very basic brick building with a corrugated steel roof, but if American food TV is to be believed, these features mark a place as a true gem. I ordered a Hawaiian pineapple pork brisket and Steph got a barbecue pork ‘slaw brisket. I instinctively avoid Hawaiian on other dishes, like pizza, but barbecue seems to be the generally accepted exception to the poor taste rule. The dishes were delicious. The place itself was run by war veterans and seemed to hire them exclusively. We saw a lot of the same ‘pseudo-right’ imagery as the shooting range, ie lots of second amendment stuff but nothing outwardly conservative. From all the photographs, the place seemed to have a real solid place in the community, and I could see why.</p>
                            <img src={Day6Pic5} alt="Day 6 Pic 5" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>We took a walk around the neighbourhood and got immersed in the old town splendour of the place. Most of the place was a perfectly idyllic picture of the past, but it wasn’t long until we got a little reminder of Idaho’s troubled reputation. We came across an antique shop that would have looked perfectly quaint and interesting – if not for the fact that the front window was absolutely wallpapered by Trump flags. There was a Let’s Go Brandon, a God, Guns and Trump and a few others dotted around. I was immediately put into mind of the pawn shop from Pulp Fiction. Having absolutely no desire to follow the misfortunes of Ving Rhames in that film, I snapped a picture of the place and we moved all the way on.</p>
                            <img src={Day6Pic6} alt="Day 6 Pic 6" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>Our next stop was a place I’d spotted when we came in: a dessert place that sold huckleberry products, including huckleberry fudge. I’d heard some very good things about huckleberry, the regional sweet delicacy of the mountain states, and having a massive sweet tooth I was keen to try it. The place was decked out in true 1950s bakery style; I half expected Marty McFly to walk in while the song Mister Sandman played in the background. There was a young guy barely out of his teens manning the counter, effeminate but in that Hallmark-friendly way, and he was more than happy to give us a selection of samples. He told us about the Eastern Idaho State Fair that was taking place in town, and while we would have definitely gone if the dates lined up for our return trip, they didn’t.</p>
                            <p>Throughout the entire conversation, he focused his attention entirely on me – which I didn’t notice, but Steph did. She wondered if it was a race thing but I pointed out a much more likely truth – he was into me. That’s not just me being bigheaded; he seemed quite captivated, and Steph was quite quick to agree when we talked about it after. We bought some ice cream after eating our weight in fudge, but it wasn’t the smartest choice in thirty degree heat, and the damn things had mostly melted by the time we got back to the car, leaving a desperate race against time to lick the sticky, fully-liquid treat off our fingers before it all dripped away.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>We continued going north, driving down Route 91 to get to West Yellowstone. The blistering heat of the Utah-Idaho border was replaced with a slightly cooler breeze. We stopped off at a little town called Ashton on the border of Idaho’s Caribou-Targhee National Forest, for the pure reason that they had a gigantic sign depicting a root beer float outside a particular diner.</p>
                            <img src={Day6Pic7} alt="Day 6 Pic 7" className="portraitPictures" />
                            <p>I love root beer. The slightly medicinal taste that other people – Steph included – seem to hate makes the dish delicious to me, and it’s the perfect level of sweetness for my palette. I also love floats, although I haven’t thought to make one in years. I don’t know why; it’s not a sophisticated construction. You just scoop some ice cream on top of coke or root beer. The place was a real community diner; we heard our waitress gossiping with some of the regulars about the comings and going in the town. I had a delicious root beer float in a takeaway plastic cup and Steph had a coke.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>It was the early evening when we got to our final destination of West Yellowstone, right on the Idaho-Montana border. As we drove down Main Street, I imagined this is exactly what the town of Aspen would be like. It was a real hub of visitors to Yellowstone as well as outdoor sporting enthusiasts, especially skiers. It was that perfect fusion of resort town and mountain village.</p>
                            <img src={Day6Pic1} alt="Day 6 Pic 1" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p>We found our motel a couple of side streets away – the Dude and Roundup. After the cold corporate ‘charms’ of the Salt Lake City Ramada, this place was an absolute godsend. That’s not to say that it was a beautiful luxury hotel – it was an austere dump of a roadside motel. But compared to the type of place where depressed businessmen go to kill themselves, the Dude was a piece of classic shabby Americana. It put me immediately in mind of the motel from No Country for Old Men, albeit with less psychotic Mexican hitmen – but the same amount of stains. The effect was bolstered by the crotchety motel keeper, a woman in her fifties that gave off the impression of taking no crap.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>We took our suitcases in and headed into town. We had laundry to do – lots of it – and we also wanted to have a couple of drinks, get some food, and buy some souvenirs. We stopped off at a creaky old laundrette being run by a creaky old man. He acted like we didn’t exist, which we didn’t really care about – we put our washing on and headed to a popular alley a few blocks down featuring the majority of the town’s souvenir shops. The aesthetic of each was very similar, with a woody outdoorish theme and quaint, quirky statues outside.</p>
                            <img src={Day6Pic8} alt="Day 6 Pic 8" className="portraitPictures"></img>
                            <p>We bought a good chunk of our souvenirs for people back home, drifting back and forth to the laundry to check our process and transfer the wet clothes to the dryer once they were done. We went into a hunting and fishing shop and bought what would become my closest companion in the journey apart from my new wife – a can of bear mace. We would soon be going right into several of the biggest bear habitats of the western hemisphere, and while our risk of bear attacks paled in comparison to, say, being caught up in a mass shooting, we wanted to take every possible precaution short of buying a gun.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>Once we were done with the shop and the laundry, we headed over to a little bar and restaurant, sitting outside. The evening was slightly cool but it was very refreshing, not cold. We had a pizza each and a couple of local beers, then got to bed early. We had a big day ahead of us – Yellowstone National Park.</p>

                            <p>It’s fair to say that of all the things we wanted to see in the various trips we planned when sketching out our second great American journey, Yellowstone was a complete favourite. It vies with Yosemite as the greatest National Park America has to offer, and since we’d seen Yosemite, we absolutely couldn’t pass up a chance to go.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>We set off bright and early, wanting to make the most out of the place. We’d opted for two days in Yellowstone; we’d learned our lesson after Yosemite, which left us wanting more after only one proper day in the park. It was just over half an hour to get to the western entrance to the park, at which point we’d be buying our America the Beautiful Pass – that one passcard that would grant us access to pretty much every National Park and wildlife refuge in the United States, and which – in the absence of any bears to use our bear mace on – would be our most useful purchase in the US.</p>
                            <img src={Day7Pic2} alt="Day 7 Pic 2" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>As soon as we got through the checkpoint, we were greeted by some of the best scenery the western US could offer. Tall forests of pine and sequoia, rolling grasslands, rivers and herds of gigantic bison grazing peacefully. Obviously I’m just describing the picture above, but it’s fair to say that this idyllic little picture is a good impression of the wonders of Yellowstone. As amazing as it was, though, the scenery was a secondary attraction for the first part of our day. We were going to see Old Faithful, the largest of the major geysers at the park. We’d been to geysers before, in Iceland, and Old Faithful was definitely a match for the largest we’d seen, Strokkur. We parked up at the visitor centre nearby and looked out for the trailhead for a small hike of about a mile to a lookout point where we could see the next eruption. Old Faithful doesn’t erupt like Strokkur, which goes off every five minutes; it goes off once every hour and a half or so, and is quite regimented in its execution.It was a steep but short trek to the top, and quite a few people had decided to watch this one alongside us – but many, many more had chosen the comfort of the viewing platform at the ground level. We waited for around ten minutes – then it began.</p>
                            <img src={Day7Pic3} alt="Day 7 Pic 3" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>Watching Old Faithful erupt, especially with this view, is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The boiling jet of water goes up hundreds of feet in the air, a jet fuelled by the raw power of the earth. It’s not just one brief eruption though; the whole process takes around five minutes, and slowly builds from a little spurt of water all the way to the huge crescendo. Everyone was watching the event with rapt attention, and we were glad that we’d made the extra effort for a vantage point.</p>
                            <img src={Day7Pic4} alt="Day 7 Pic 4" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>When the eruption was over, we headed off to go see the next big attraction of Yellowstone – the hot springs, including the one absolutely everyone has seen even if their only experience of the park is Google; the Grand Prismatic Spring. It’s one of the biggest and most impressive hot springs in the world. There were other hot springs leading to it – their colours were utterly amazing and they looked so perfect and pristine. The water in them was boiling – we’d learned that before in Iceland – so we were forced to stay on a boardwalk all the way around. Even outside of the pools themselves, the volcanic soil can easily give way under a hiking boot, leaving your foot in boiling water. As we approached, we saw the vibrant boiling earth around the spring itself. Apparently it’s caused by a strange form of bacteria that circles the spring, but it looks amazing. Beyond that, we could see the spring itself – a brilliant shimmering pool of the most tranquil blue, bubbling and steaming away. It was an amazing, unforgettable sight.      </p>
                            <img src={Day7Pic1} alt="Day 7 Pic 1" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>We carried along the pathway and saw several smaller pools, including one strikingly blue pool called Emerald Spring. It didn’t have the red and orange rings around it; instead it was surrounded by ashy ground. The sparse surroundings accentuated the vibrant blue colour of the pool; it wasn’t as steamy as the Prismatic Spring, so all we could see was a flawless light sapphire colour all the way down.</p>
                            <img src={Day7Pic5} alt="Day 7 Pic 5" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>We made our way down the boardwalk, taking in the amazing sights of the pool springs. The earth was volcanic and ashy; it was a little reminder that a lot of Yellowstone is basically a huge active volcano. It was around this time where we saw a couple of people, young guys, go off the path exploring. A park ranger called out to them furiously but it fell on deaf ears. He was there to greet them when they got to the other side of the boardwalk – and I imagine he would quickly make them regret it, because the penalties of going off the boardwalk at Yellowstone are severe. You can do jailtime and get a fine to the tune of thousands of dollars – it’s essential to prevent deaths.  </p>
                            <img src={Day7Pic6} alt="Day 7 Pic 6" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>After a trip around to the shores of the nearby Yellowstone Lake, we headed over to see the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone – a gigantic chasm right in the middle of the park, very much a similar, if narrow, version of its namesake in Arizona. It was a bizarre but breath-taking setup; you parked up and walked down a path on what you would otherwise seem like a flat bit of land, then the landscape just opens and you’re faced with the breathtaking sight of the canyon, looking very much like it was dug out by some cosmic shovel. A narrow river was running through it in the middle and snaking round to the right, hundreds of yards away. It was an absolutely fantastic sight.</p>
                            <img src={Day7Pic7} alt="Day 7 Pic 7" className="landscapePictures" />
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>It was getting late, so we drove back to West Yellowstone, spotting a family of grazing deer as we did. We got into town in the early evening and started looking around for some food. We had a walk around town; it wasn’t as lively as the other night, but it was still a happening place to be. We fancied something simple for dinner, so after walking around looking for inspiration, we settled on the local McDonalds. We were tired after a long day of walking, so went to bed quite early. Tomorrow, we were spending our morning/early afternoon in Yellowstone before a three hour drive. We were going further north, right into the state’s heartland – Helena, state capital of Montana. </p>
                        </div>}

                    <div onClick={expandDay8} id="day8Expander" className="headings">
                        <h4 className="dayHeader">Day 8</h4>
                        <h5 className="dayLocation">Helena</h5>
                    </div>

                    {day8 &&
                        <div>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>Our time in Yellowstone was drawing to a close, so we had to choose our last activity carefully. We decided to opt for the Bunsen Peak trail, a medium-difficulty trail that would get us there and back before it was time to move on. The Bunsen Peak is a small, sloping mountain that we could scale without much difficulty. We pulled up to the Mammoth Campground car park and saw the warnings – bears had been spotted in this area quite recently. That wouldn’t have been a problem on its own, but Steph needed to go to the toilet – and human poo is one of the many things that attracts bears! I kept watch as she took a quick squat on a nearby hill and we went on, hoping that a random bear wouldn’t be drawn to the car park by an unfamiliar smell.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>The landscape was amazing. We could see as far as the eye could see as soon as we got out of the initial narrow line of trees. The vision stretched all the way to the distant mountains on some unknown end of the park. We kept a close eye out for bears and clapped our hands loudly to make them aware of our presence, but this was too open space for a bear to appear – much less present a threat to us.</p>
                            <p>The elevation was fine at first – but then got steep. Very steep. We would have been able to deal with it, except the sun was beating down heavily on us. It got tougher and tougher, and we made the grudging decision to halt the trail half way and do the major attraction we’d been interested in – West Yellowstone Grizzly and Wolf Discovery Centre, a sanctuary for bears, wolves and other endangered species in the Yellowstone region. It would be our only chance to see some of the gigantic grizzlies that populated the area unless one ended up in London Zoo. If we’d hit the top of the peak we wouldn’t have had a chance to hit it properly unless we committed to getting to Helena in the late evening, and we definitely wanted to give it a proper visit.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>Of course, we couldn’t admit that we hadn’t finished the walk when we passed all the experienced hikers on the way down, so we committed to lying – which we did a few times. We kept it vague (“Oh, it gets steeper as you get further up, but the peak is totally worth it!”) and sounded as confident as we could. After a couple of blagged encounters we got back to the cars – no bears sniffing around for Steph’s poo – we got on the road.</p>
                            <p>The wildlife centre started with an interesting museum that had lots of fascinating animal sculptures. It had a fascinating film about bear attacks, giving different strategies of survival based on the different types of bears. Black bears are very easy to intimidate, grizzlies will generally back off if you play dead (it’s not about making them think you’re dead, they’re not stupid, it’s about establishing that you’re not a competitor to them) and polar bears, well, there is no strategy. You fight for your life with everything you have, which won’t be anywhere near enough to repel them, because if you don’t there is absolutely nothing separating them from your tasty innards.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>The educational part of the experience out of the way, we went to go out and see the bears – and wow. There were three giant grizzlies relaxing past a thick chainlink fence. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen a grizzly bear up close, but they are huge and terrifying. They’re infinitely bigger and more powerful than you – they  can lift over 500 kilos in one go and their bite can crush a bowling ball. They’re faster than you too – they can run up to forty miles an hour. I felt a lot safer with a huge chain link fence separating us, but when one came close to me I still felt like I was facing down a force of nature.</p>
                            <p>There were three bears, and they had a large enclosure, much larger than they’d have got in a zoo. They had a narrow stream running through it which they relaxed around, enjoying the hot sun. I imagine the experience wasn’t as half as nice for them as the wild forests would be, especially as an apex predator in a park that banned hunting. But it wasn’t the worst place I could imagine them in, and it’s good for conservation too.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>We saw the wolves next – they are a sight to behold. I always assume looking at wolves in an Attenborough doc that they’re not dissimilar to huskies, just big friendly dogs that haven’t been domesticated yet. As a guy who believes that I can de-escalate any angry dog with a commanding voice – and it’s been proved true on several occasions, especially with a pack of rabid street dogs in Jaffna – I’ve never had any concern about wolves.</p>
                            <p>Seeing them in person, especially in a pack, is quite a different experience altogether. You can see why Oregon Trail caravaners were so terrified of seeing a pack appearing over some ridge. They are predators. Their cunning, aquiline faces have a sort of evil glee in them, like some sort of murderous hybrid that combines the keen hunting instinct of a fox with the sadistic glee of a hyena. Don’t get me wrong; they’re still beautiful, fascinating animals, and seeing them was an incredible experience. But I’d hate to be all that stands between a hungry pack and its next meal on some lonesome night. </p>
                            <p>There was a bird sanctuary too, and for the only time so far in America, I saw its spirit animal – the bald eagle. There was an indoor centre with an aquatic setup, which featured several different species of Yellowstone river fish, as well as the highlight – otters! They were set up in a tank where you could see them both above and below water. There didn’t seem to be as much space for them as there was the bears, but they didn’t seem to mind, diving in and out of the water as a tight unit. It was amazing to see their energetic display, and we watched them for a solid ten minutes.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>When we were done at the wildlife centre, we got on the road. We had a three hour journey to Helena, the state capital of Montana. It was a tiny city – just over thirty thousand people, so it was bizarre to me that it was the capital of such a huge state. Of course, we all know examples of tiny towns in states that have huge cities; the state capital of New York, for example, isn’t NYC but a tiny town called Albany, and the capital of California isn’t LA or San Fran but the city of Sacramento. But to think of such a city – more of a large town – being the administrative centre of so many hundreds of miles of open space seemed strange to me.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>Montana is a wild state. As we got further north, we saw miles and miles of open scenery, able to see through to the mountains in the far distance. Of all the states we’d been to, Montana had the wildest scenery by far. As for human civilisation, I don’t know what I’d expected from Montana, whether it was modern towns or simple homesteads, but much of Montana was neither – it was, all things told, a little beaten-up. We passed through town after town of rough-looking, decrepit houses, abandoned pickups, and crumbling downtowns. I saw a lot of what you could call American brutalism – the ugliness of the 1960s council estate in the UK crossed with the ugly American tenement buildings of the nineteenth century. </p>
                            <p>So not all of the great state of Montana was natural beauty, but it didn’t do anything to spoil a lovely drive. What did briefly spoil things was a small crack we got in our windscreen after the wheels of the truck in front of us unleashed some stones from the road in our direction. We pulled over to assess the damage – as we’d gone with Turo as opposed to one of the major hire car dealers, we had a bit more to worry about with damage. The crack was small but noticeable both from inside and out of the car. It turned out that Helena had six Autoglass-style places to fix a windscreen, but we had a better option than that – a kit we could buy from Walmart.</p>
                            <p>It was to some relief when we approached Helena and found that it was on the nicer side. It wasn’t, to be uncharitable, anything to write home about, even if this is theoretically what I’m doing – it’s a prime example of a small, suburban Midwestern city no bigger than somewhere like Guildford, and with much less population. Aesthetically, Helena was a mix – parts of it reminded me of Iceland or northern Norway, with brightly-coloured corrugated iron frame houses, but most of our entrypoint to the place was the typical highway surround you see across America, with absolutely no houses directly on the highway path, only large commercial buildings – motels, furniture stores, Subways, and more. We were staying at a place called Super 8 – one of many chainy roadside motels in town. They were clustered together in an area, which didn’t seem to make that much sense, because for one, it wasn’t right bang in the middle of town, and secondly, you’d think that would cut into the competition. The place had less of an overtly corporate feel than the Ramada, but still lacked charm – and the room was a bit uninspiring. Still, the guy on the front desk was very friendly, and there was a nice breakfast area where we could eat our fill in the morning.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>It was late afternoon/early evening when we arrived, so our minds drifted onto the topic of food. There wasn’t much in the way of fine dining in poor old Helena, but we did find what looked like a half-decent sushi place. We drove over there and were unsurprised to see a plan-looking strip mall building off the highway. Helena does have a downtown area – I believe it’s only one street, but most of the city is one gigantic strip mall. The place was quite down-at-home but looked fine, and was popular enough to have a queue to be seated. We sat in a little alcove room with around six other couples waiting to be seated, drawing the usual curious-but-not-suspicious glances that an interracial married couple who spoke to the Maître D in an English accent could expect when in a city like Helena. We got seated shortly after and explored the menu.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>The order of the day was vegetables. Anyone who’s spent a couple of weeks in America will know that the cuisine will wreak havoc on your belly. The American diet is so different to the British one, and because you’re on holiday, you lean into the least-healthy parts of the menu and think less about things like making sure you get good roughage. The outcome will be bad stomach aches and constipation and will leave even the worst eaters hunting around for a salad bar. Steph ordered sushi and I ordered prawn tempura with vegetables on the side, thinking – quite rightfully if we were in the UK – that just the prawn would be in batter.</p>
                            <p>Everything was tempura’d. The prawns. The asparagus. The mushrooms. The broccoli. It was the most bizarre dish I’d ever seen, and if anyone had presented the dish to me in any other circumstance than that evening, I’d have snapped it up. As a result, I was desperate for the roughage underneath the thick coat of batter, but I wolfed it down hoping the fibre would break through. It was pretty tasty, but I’ve had better tempura – and Steph’s sushi was definitely better. We had a beer each, a local speciality, and didn’t linger long afterwards.</p>
                            <p>The night could have been over then and there – but it didn’t end up like that. Earlier when arriving, we’d spotted a bar down the road with a neon red ‘Casino’ sign in front. We decided to go in there for a drink. There had been one part of the great American experience we hadn’t gone for thus far – drinks in the classic roadside saloon. It was mostly because of our travel schedule – by the time we got to a new place it was either early enough to fit in a hike or late enough for dinner to be the main consideration. If we did have more of an evening spare, we’d most likely have a big hike or a bigger drive in the morning, and a night of drinking didn’t really appeal. Tonight, though, was going to be the exception.</p>
                            <p>The place couldn’t have looked more classic. It had everything you’d expect from a classic US bar. It had American football on the TV, neon beer signs behind the bar, a pool table and lots of baseball caps. We ordered a couple of beers from a friendly barmaid and sat down. I was happy enough to see that it was a college ball game, Oregon State University versus Boise. I’ve got a certain affinity for OSU – I spent time in Corvallis, the home of the Beavers, and while I didn’t actually go to any games, I did go to a tailgate party once, and I’ve watched them on TV since. So I got into the game, trying to get Steph interested and explain the rules, but it wasn’t taking. So I watched it myself as I drank, until the guy next to me – quite understandably curious given my accent – asked me why I was rooting for Oregon. </p>
                            <p>Eric, true to openhearted American form, soon told me his life story. He’d been a veteran in Afghanistan and had taken the railroad job from one of his ex-comrades. He’d moved in with a woman who lived nearby and was a sort of father to her children. I ended up giving him a real pep-talk, saying it was a great thing what he was doing – he got very emotional. It was an extremely deep conversation, nothing like I’d ever have with a stranger in a pub in the UK. I’ve long since given up the idea of moving to the US, or regarding it as a sort of positive thing – it’s quite a horrible place to work in or try to get healthcare in – I thought to myself that I could make friends so easily if I lived over here.</p>
                            <p>A few beers in, the night was shifting slightly. Eric headed away for a little while, I can’t remember why – it may have been the bathroom, but he was gone a while, Steph pulled me away into playing pool with a couple of people she’d met. There was a guy and a girl – not a couple – who she’d fallen in with. I’ll call them Mark and Kelly for convenience although I’m almost certain those aren’t their names. Kelly seemed very kind, but I got a bad read from Mark. He was friendly, but in that ‘we’re best buddies, but I’m only one line of coke in the toilets away from glassing you’ way. He had the face and bald head of a young Michael Rooker but the voice and aggressively zealous laugh of Goodfellas-era Ray Liotta. </p>
                            <p>We played pool and he gave me some story about being involved in investment banking I didn’t particularly believe. Eric came back over and I tried to get him involved but he didn’t stick around for long – he didn’t get much of a good reading off of Mark either it seemed. I got talking to another guy, who I’ll call Paul, who was an older guy in Mark’s circle wearing a trucker hat and a tanktop. He was a plastic Paddy, which was fine with me because I am too, and we knew a lot of the same songs. </p>
                            <p>I was getting steadily drunk, so drunk that I didn’t notice trouble brewing. It was Steph who clued me in at first, telling me that she thought there might be rumblings from a table over in the corner, who’d apparently been up for the pool table before we jumped on. That didn’t seem too insurmountable to me, and I made a point to get chatting to one of the guys from that table as he was walking through. This guy, a young black guy who’ll call Adam even though this is a complete guess as we never exchanged names, didn’t seem pissed off at all so I told Steph all was well – and from their side, it was. Shortly after, the real trouble began.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>I’d found myself in the corner with Paul, drunkenly singing the Pogues at the top of our voices, when Steph and Mark came over. Mark was all jubilant for some reason, whereas Steph looked very worried. She told me that we had to go now. We headed out the door immediately, more running than walking back to the motel. When we got there, Steph explained that someone had come into the bar and immediately had a problem with Adam – not because of any petty beef with a pool table, but because he was…unpleasantly surprised to see a black guy in his local bar. Apparently it had been Mark – to his credit, I must say – that told the guy where to go, hence his oddly cheerful attitude. It looked like some sort of huge fight was about to be brewing, and we’d left at just the right time. It was our first real taste of the divided America we’d heard so much about, and was more jarring than any Trump 2024 sign in a person’s window.</p>

                            <p>We woke up the next morning with the hangover of our lives. It was our first real drink of the trip and had hit us hard. We wondered what had taken place at the bar last night after we left. I also wondered about what Eric, Mark, Kelly, Paul or Adam would say about us and whether we’d be the topic of conversation in the bars of Helena for days to come. </p>
                            <p>Today was originally going to be all about hiking the Lewis and Clark National Forest – but our pounding heads put a big question mark over that. We had a late start, only one of us – me – leaving before midday, and that was to stack up a big breakfast for the two of us downstairs. We tossed up whether to leave the motel room or not and eventually decided to make a drive over to one of the easier trails in the forest. The journey was short, but was a nightmare, and not just because of our headaches. Essentially, our path went off the paved road and left us shuddering along a long line of cobblestones that made the chip in the windscreen look like a smudge. We eventually got to the trailhead, but neither of us could bring ourselves to start walking – so we got straight back in the car and left, deciding we’d have to satisfy ourselves with a scenic drive. We got back to the room, napped, and went to get some dinner at a little Mexican place downtown. </p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>It wasn’t much of a day all in all – but it’s nice to have a bit of a break between bouts of strenuous adventure.</p>
                        </div>}

                        <h5 className="dayLocation">Glacier National Park</h5>
                    </div>

                    {day10 &&
                        <div>
                            <p>We’d had our day of rest, and it was time to get back on the road. Once again, we were going north – as north, in fact, as it’s possible to go without crossing the border. Our most northernly stop was going to be one of our definitive highlights along the way – it had been one of the major reasons we’d decided to have Montana as our end destination. Glacier National Park.</p>
                            <p>Glacier was the dream – the wild, frozen north. The park was right on the Canadian border, and indeed crossed over in several places. In the winter, the glaciers shine amongst the icy wilderness and the lakes get frozen. We were, of course, visiting in late summer, but the glaciers still dominated the landscape.</p>
                            <p>They wouldn’t always be – they get closer to annihilation every year, and one day they’ll be gone completely. In those depressing times it will have been a point of boasting among Americans for someone to say they saw the great glaciers before the end, but it was purely the environmental reality – not the boasting – that meant it was so important to see them.</p>
                            <p>I’d had a slight misapprehension about what a glacier was. I thought they were more like icebergs, due in no small part to the fact that packs of glacier mints feature a polar bear on one. As it turns out, they’re large patches of compacted ice (not at all clear, but thick and white) that hang on the breath-taking mountains of the area.</p>
                            <p>We’d narrowly scored tickets to the Going to the Sun Road, an eye-catching scenic highway that also marked access to all the important trailheads. It was a difficult ask to get these tickets; they’re on a first-come-first-serve basis with a focus on restricting traffic, with the occasional lottery to spice things up. The Going to the Sun Road was going to be a crucial part of our park experience over the next couple of days, and we’d have struggled without it.</p>
                            <p>First, we had to get to the park itself. It wasn’t the longest journey we’d done so far – three and a half hours – but it felt like a huge lurch north. It was also our most northerly point on the journey. We had mixed feelings about this – on the one hand, we couldn’t believe that we’d gone from a state that touched the Mexican border (Arizona) all the way to a couple of miles from the Canadian. We’d bisected the mighty United States. We hadn’t done it from border to border, or at one of the widest points – the journey from the Texan Gulf through to the top of North Dakota takes a whopping 27 hours – but it still felt like a gigantic journey compared to the California/Nevada/Arizona loop we’d done previously, which was no small feat in itself. On the other hand, it was a grim reminder that our trip was reaching the halfway point – we’d planned to spend half the time going up and half the time coming down.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>The towns we drove through seemed much nicer than the urban squalor we’d seen on the drive to Helena. These were picturesque little places that looked just like the small towns we’d seen in every American film that didn’t take place in California or New England. The town of Choteau, in particular – which was of course called a city because it had more than ten people – vied with Blackfoot for its simplistic charm, and while the former looked like a Stephen King novel, Choteau looked more like a Wes Craven film. A few reminders that the idyllic idea of the fifties was gone still persisted – mostly Trump 2024 signs – but it would have definitely been a place we would have stopped in if we didn’t have something slightly more visually impressive to go to.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>Speaking of Blackfeet, our route also took us through Blackfeet reservation lands, centred around the town of Browning. The signs of Native American influence were all around, from the museums to the street murals. On the one hand, it was reassuring to see an original culture keep its traditions in this way, but on the other hand this modern, built up town was a sobering reminder that all those years the Europeans had imposed their ways on Native Americans paid off. Browning seemed to be relatively lucky as far as social issues were concerned; from what I understood a lot of reservations had huge problems with drug addiction and poverty, and while Browning could have those, it seemed a well-run community. </p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>We were staying in one of the most remote accommodations yet – Montana’s Duck Lake Lodge, an isolated place a few miles’ drive from town – which amounted to one narrow road of a couple restaurants, one shop and a bar. We were going to head over there later on – there was late check-in and we had lots of Glacier we wanted to see. So we headed up the Going to the Sun Road towards the South Shore Trailhead – where we’d be completing a circular trail around the famous Two Medicine Lake.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>The lake was absolutely beautiful. The water was the most brilliant shade of blue, and sparked in the early afternoon sun. It was surrounded by lush hills and mountains, and while we wouldn’t be walking up those, this was at least a moderate hike. It was around seven miles, meaning a good chunk of the afternoon. The trail – just like every part of Glacier – had a very high risk of bears, and I had my bear mace ready.</p>
                            <p>The trail set off beautifully, with a perfect view of the mountains on either side of the path. It wasn’t busy at all, and we were able to enjoy the scenery in pretty much perfect solitude. The trees up here were mostly pines and firs, and they made the place look almost Nordic. By this point, we’d properly stretched our legs as far as endurance was concerned, and we felt no strain as we attacked the gentle incline. There were few breaks, most of them for water alone, leaving us lots of time to hike and take in the mountain air.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>The trail had a good few Stand by Me-type moments. One of our favourites early on was a long rope bridge which hung over a ravine. It was strictly one-at-a-time, and quite honestly looked as if any more at one time would have destroyed the thing. It shook and creaked as we walked over it, and I half expected to see Mola Ram’s henchmen waiting for us on the other side.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>Once we headed out of the wooded area, the scenery was wide open. We could see distant glaciers clinging to the mountainsides, a wide river a few miles away, and scenery that simply had to stretch into Canada. You could see for miles every side, and we realised we were quite high up.</p>
                            <p>It was late afternoon by the time we completed our trail, getting back to the beach at the other side of the trailhead. Looking back at the lake itself, we couldn’t believe we’d done a circuit around the whole thing. </p>
                            <p>We drove over to the Duck Lake Lodge, taking it in for the first time. The place was absolutely jumping with character. It was contained within one building, which only had the reception and a little kitchen area, and some rooms on the second floor. It was surrounded by wilderness and wildlife – predominantly cows from next door’s farm, moose, bison, deer – and lots of bears. We were told to exercise utmost caution if leaving the place at night, as bears were all over the woods. We were on a beautiful lake, miles from any form of civilisation, other than the farm. The place was an instant win, but there were a small handful of drawbacks – small single beds, a poky room. The only bigger drawback was the lack of shared bathrooms. For all the trip thus far, even if we’d had basic places, we’d had private bathrooms, and that trend would continue. The last time we’d had shared accommodation had been back in a little hotel in Yorkshire the year before, and it wasn’t the nicest experience. </p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>We weren’t too worried, though, as the place seemed to be relatively deserted. We dropped off our bags and went off in search of dinner. There were a couple of restaurants in the tiny road that passed for Main Street in Babb, the census-designated place (America can’t bear to call a town a town) and the most well-known and regarded one was a Blackfeet-owned steakhouse called the Cattle Baron. This irked me more than it should have; America’s cattle barons, with their rapacious hoarding of land and cattle in the West, were the natural enemies of Native Americans and one of the primary death-knells in their way of life before industrialisation arrived in the region. It would be like a kosher restaurant calling itself Eichmann’s. </p>
                            <p>But it wasn’t just the name of the place that ended up annoying me that evening. Instead of recanting it now, months later and quite unaffected by the whole thing, I’d like to summarise my angrier thoughts in a Google review closer to the time:</p>
                            <div style={{border: '1px solid black'}}>
                                <p style={{width: '80vw', fontSize: '12px', marginLeft: '10px'}}>Firstly - the manager was great. Very reasonable, apologised for the bad service and took my overcooked steak off the bill. If not for our server I never would have written the review.</p>
                                <p style={{width: '80vw', fontSize: '12px', marginLeft: '10px'}}>We arrived at the restaurant and were given a 35 minute wait - it's Labor Day so that's totally fine - and we were told by our hostess that she'd come and get us from the bar. We went to the bar and the bartender was pretty bad. She couldn't pour a beer and we had quite a bit of trouble ordering even though she wasn't serving anyone else at the time. I think she was new so that's okay. After around 50m I went to the hostess to ask if there was any update and she'd a) forgotten about us and b) were letting in a party the same size as ours who had just walked in. When I brought this up she gave a vague apology and kinda shrugged.</p>
                                <p style={{width: '80vw', fontSize: '12px', marginLeft: '10px'}}>Our server, Kuersten was initially very nice and apologised for the bad service. We ordered steak. Mine was overcooked and the salad was terrible. We spoke to the manager and he very kindly took my steak off the bill. Kuersten took my payment - then insulted us because we didn't tip, even though the card machine didn't give us the option to! We always tip, and would have tipped here too because none of this was her fault. We'd tipped around the 15% mark on both the drinks we ordered. But we didn't get the chance, and her terrible attitude pretty much ruined everything.</p>
                                <p style={{width: '80vw', fontSize: '12px', marginLeft: '10px'}}>In short, manager great, venue great,  food overpriced and overcooked, hostess and our server terrible.</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>So the restaurant was terrible, but essentially we got it mostly for free!</p>
                            <p>We headed back to the lodge, but we were in the mood for some more adventure before we turned in. We decided to head towards the park at night and see the stars. Glacier is fantastic for seeing stars - there’s no light pollution as it’s so far from any town large enough to generate it. We took the torch that the lodge had kindly provided and headed out, driving for about twenty minutes before we reached one of the smaller lakes. There was no light at all. We were still technically just off the highway, but headlamps were few and far between. The scene was incredibly peaceful, and cemented to us what we’d felt on arrival - we were in the middle of the back of beyond.</p>
                            <p>I got out of the car first - Steph said she only wanted to get out if the coast was a hundred percent clear of bears and I could see incredible stars. Embracing my role as the human guinea pig, I stepped out, clapping my hands so as not to startle the bears, shining my torch around to make sure the coast was clear. I looked up - there was a thin cover of cloud over the sky, meaning that the incredible night’s sky wasn’t going to come to us. I remarked as much to Steph, and was about to get back in the car, when I heard it.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>It was a low, grumbling noise that could have come from a mile away or a few feet. It could have either been animal or mechanical. I thought to myself that it had to be a boat on the lake, and said as much to Steph, and she said, no little terror in her voice - “or a bear.” I had no desire to find out - I got straight back in the car and we made our way back to the lodge, keeping an eye on our surroundings at all times.</p>

                            <p>The next morning, I was lucky enough to wake up before dawn. I’d been waking up pretty early since before the start of the trip, and the continually changing beds had only increased the trend. Normally, it was a bit of an annoyance, but today it was anything but. I decided I was going to go outside and spot a bear.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>Bears have finally come to the realisation that humans, with our guns and our bear mace, have ascended the food chain and are less prey than mutual predator. Not rivals, per se; they hate challenges to their authority and would become pretty aggressive if that’s how they saw us. What it means in practice is that bears, unless they’re starving, will be happy to entertain a ‘you go your way, I’ll go mine’ attitude where humans are concerned. While this means less chances of death for hikers like us, it also means that you’re much less likely to even see a bear – with exceptions. Bears are much more likely to come out at night, up to the dawn. They also get slightly closer to human settlements – less lights, plus they know that our sleep schedule is a lot more regulated than theirs.</p>
                            <p>I’d seen the impressive grizzlies over at the park in West Yellowstone, but I still wanted to get a good look at bears in the wild. So I got ready quietly, grabbing a torch that had been provided by the front desk. It was just before dawn when I made my way out, and I saw a few signs of life already in the form of a few cows that had strayed loose from the farm. They moved away from me sharpish, but they also didn’t seem generally nervous, which I took as a sign that if Mister Bear was around, he was keeping his head down. I walked around, shining the torch everywhere I went – the light means they’re less likely to show themselves to you, but the very last thing you ever want to do to a bear is startle them. As we’d learned in the instructional video at West Yellowstone, making yourself known is the most important bear strategy, and a major chunk of bear attacks have just been because a bear got startled. Even worse is that if the bear doesn’t spot you, you may accidentally wander to the space between them and their cubs – an almost guaranteed strategy for death. </p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>So I shone my torch around everywhere I went, terrified that I was going to turn around one corner and just see a pair of terrifying predator eyes staring at me. I didn’t stray too far away from the lodge, and avoided the nearby woods altogether – even with the torch/mace combination, my chances of becoming a yearly statistic would have risen considerably. The only time they recommend that you run from a bear – and it is literally the only time, because they’re infinitely faster than a human – is where you have an easy place of shelter within a short sprinting distance, and I figured that even a psychotic grizzly would be too afraid of being trapped to follow me into the Lodge if I was close enough to make it in.</p>
                            <p>I didn’t end up seeing a bear on my little excursion. What I did get to see – apart from the cows – was a night full of stars followed by the pleasant sight of the sun rising over the hill. I hung out there for a little while, marvelling that I was allowed to experience such an isolated corner of the world. </p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>Steph was up before long, and I told her about my little excursion. We had breakfast and headed out via the one outward road. It was on that road that we saw what I’d been searching for all morning – a bear! It was a small black bear, who was very skittish – it was running out of the road as fast as it could – and I didn’t get anywhere near a good picture of it. The small dark dot on the left of the below photo is the best shot I got by the time I got my camera ready. At the same time, I was still quite glad I hadn’t run into this guy out on the road at night.</p>
                            <p>We got into the park quite early on and headed to a visitor centre to stock up on supplies, including snacks. Our snacks had been quite varied so far – lots of savoury, a few sweet, very few healthy. I also had a chance to buy the only thing other than bear mace and preparedness that can help survive a bear attack – a knife. If all other methods for deterring Mister Bear from thinking that you’re food (anything from hand signals to an automatic rifle) fail – and they sometimes will – a good knife is the only thing from you and a forest grave. The bear will get close and go for the face, and you need to slash, stab and thrust at him until he either backs off or you hit his jugular. I viewed this as a nightmare scenario to be avoided at all costs, but would still have preferred to have a knife than not.</p>
                            <p>I wanted a knife for home too, as a keepsake from our time in the wild, and – another nightmare scenario – home defence. We’ve got much bigger knives in the kitchen, but there’s something reassuring about having a lethal weapon in the same place you sleep. I picked a folding blade with a rusty orange camo finish on the hilt I thought was eccentric but cool in a way. I wasn’t completely legal in taking it home; my work on the Buckingham Palace security check-in had taught me the particulars around knife legality in the UK. The blade looked just under three inches, which is the maximum allowance for carry, but the knife locks into place – a big no no. But I knew three things – firstly, if it was in my hold luggage, it would only get a departure and arrival scan, and wouldn’t be eligible for any random searches. Secondly, in its folded up state it looked no bigger than a nail clipper and thus would instantly pass through both ends. And thirdly, there was absolutely no chance that we’d be stopped in Steph’s dad’s car on the drive back from the airport or that they’d ever ask to look inside our suitcases. The upshot is that this knife is now at home, where it’s fully legal, secured and comfy upstairs.</p>
                            <p>I always think that I look like something of a ranger in this photo with the shirt, knife, and the hat, which I didn’t buy. But I don’t look American; with the reddish tan, facial hair covering a slight double chin, and odd expression, I always think I look like an Australian bush ranger, albeit slightly less macho.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>Today we were doing two main trails: the Avalanche Lake trail, and the Hidden Lake Overlook trail. The Hidden Lake Overlook was your classic long, elevated trail – a good three hours’ walk in total. Avalanche Lake was a shorter walk but with solid elevation. We arrived at the starting point for the Trail of the Cedars, which we would be on for a while before branching off into Avalanche. The Trail of the Cedars is a trail that takes you all the way over the forest at the base of the mountains. It’s slightly longer, but has no elevation, and not much in the way of vistas. Avalanche Lake is a there-and-back trail as opposed to a loop, and the end destination gives a commanding view of the lake – which gives ample justification to keep going.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>Our journey to the trailhead included a much longer stretch of the Going to the Sun Road, and some of the most mind-bendingly beautiful scenery we’d ever seen. We started out driving past the majestic Saint Mary Lake, an impeccably pure, unbroken gem with incredible surroundings. There wasn’t a single thing to break the surface or the tranquillity of the lake, and it was almost impossible to believe that it was a physical body of water.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>Then we climbed. We climbed high. We didn’t really perceive the sheer change in altitude, the gentle and gradual sloping of the road took care of that, but we soon found ourselves much further from the ground. The view from up here was absolutely indistinguishable from the opening scenes of the Shining with the Torrances driving down beautiful mountain roads.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>We also saw our first real sign of glaciers – dozens and dozens of glaciers, all much larger than the few small efforts we’d seen the other day. They were majestic, and while I get inconsolably sad when I think about how they won’t be there one day, it also doesn’t seem very possible. They’re huge, foreboding icicles that looked like they were less likely to melt than cause an avalanche, and that was when the summer temperature was over twenty degrees.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>We soon arrived at the trailhead and got on the path. The Trail of the Cedars began as a gentle strolls through the pines and what looked like the giant sequoias we’d seen back in California. One of the first things we saw was a huge, upturned tree that reminded us of the Iron Throne in a strange way. Being kids, we of course we played around with it.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>A large part of the ground-based trail was based on boardwalks that were dotted around the forest. I didn’t see the urgency here – the boardwalks were necessary back at Yellowstone to make sure we didn’t stick our feet in boiling mud, but here we were just being protected by overgrowth. I guessed quickly that it was the undergrowth that was actually being protected from the power of thousands of hiking boots per day, but it felt like there were more efficient ways than using precious wood to build miles of forest path.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>Soon we were ready to diverge, and the Avalanche Lake hike was marked by a sharp, immediate elevation. The passage of people had been quite consistent on the ground, but up here they dropped off slightly – not literally. We arrived at a small waterfall that towered over our path upwards; it was very narrow, but deep, and the people we’d started to walk alongside started looking like ants. We kept walking, climbing up the rocky path until we got into open woods. We walked through the undergrowth for a little under an hour before we arrived at the lake itself. Avalanche is a beautiful, scenic spot nestled in between several mountains as well as a breathtaking pine forest.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>We had Avalanche Lake almost exclusively to ourselves. It was beautifully quiet, and I thought about taking my boots off and getting my feet wet, but I figured it’d be uncomfortable for the hike back. You couldn’t hear much of anything, except for the soft trickle of the water and the occasional birdsong. We could have comfortably spent the whole day here, setting up with a spot on the grassy lakeside, but we had other things to do. We left the lake and headed back down, passing by the side of the waterfall once more and heading back down into the forested boardwalk area. We had a short drive over to the main attraction of the day: the Hidden Lake Pass trail. It was going to be quite different to what we’d encountered so far. The Avalanche Lake trail was a gradual elevation, whereas Hidden Lake started high and got quite a bit higher. Additionally, while we’d spent much of the Avalanche Lake trail thickly enclosed, Hidden Lake Pass was a wide open trail that gave us a birds-eye view for miles.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>Even the start of the trail was breathtaking. We immediately found ourselves among what must have been some of the tallest mountains in the park, and were ourselves on a rising plateau that felt like it was straight from Sound of Music. This trail, as one of the highlights of the park, was quite a bit busier than the other trail, and we found ourselves in a fairly consistent procession of fellow hikers.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>The view was more and more incredible as we got up. This was the very heart of the park, the raw landscape that you saw when you googled Glacier or even Montana. The elevation wasn’t too extreme, especially at first, and we gave ourselves generous water breaks. The furthest point in the hike was a popular scenic overlook of the Hidden Lake itself that would be well worth the journey.</p>
                            <p>We saw glaciers as up close as we’d ever see them. They were only a couple of hundred yards away in some cases, appearing in big patches that ignored the relative heat of summer. The trail was getting difficult. The elevation had started out light but quickly developed, leaving us out of breath before too long. The mountain was teeming with life. Bighorn sheep, one of few animals even up in Montana to climb up to the highest peaks, were all around us, and the birds never left us. The trail procession thinned out ever so slightly, leaving us with some privacy as we ascended. We passed a few people who’d given up, but by the time we got to the overlook, there were a good few people gathered.</p>
                            <p>The overlook was spectacular. None of the photos we took did it any sort of justice.We got a view from hundreds of feet in the air, where we could see the lake itself, as well as the hills stretching far into the distance. Everyone there was transfixed by the view, and we felt like we were on the top of the world.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>We stayed at the overlook for around ten minutes, taking a break, engrossing ourselves in the sights, and taking a break before our hike back. We knew that nothing we could take picture-wise would ever capture the beauty of the place, so we took our pictures, but promised ourselves to burn the sight into our minds forever.</p>
                            <p>The trail back felt a lot easier with the downhill angle, and we got a better look at the mountains behind us. By the time we got further down, it was already early evening. When I’ve since looked at the timing of my photos, it seems like we reached the end of our trail at a little after seven in the evening. We were getting tired and very hungry. We had no desire to go back to the only steak place in town after last night, and there wasn’t much else around, so we grabbed a couple of ready meals and snacks, plus a couple of beers, to enjoy in front of the TV back in the main area of the lodge.</p>
                            <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>Tomorrow was going to be a sad day for us - we’d be going south. Glacier was the very northernmost point in our journey, and while we still had half an amazing holiday to look forward to, the very act of going south established that this was the return leg. Back when we’d taken our first steps north to Salt Lake City, it felt like we had an endless adventure in front of us - now, at the northern tip, we realised it was pretty finite.</p>
